## Comments needed

#### Please summarise your progress and major achievements in research this year.

Over the past year I was placed on academic probation, throughout this time I have continued to work on the publications for my PhD with the focus on the first chapter and publication. This has continued to be a long process but I am happy with the progress and feel it is going in the right direction. I am confident I have all the work needed for a \"distinctive by design\" thesis. I am just not sure how long it will take to finish.

**This is the status as stands (15th Nov 2019):**

-   I have developed a reproducible framework for PhD publication and thesis construction using my PhD research as the example of this in action.

-   I have a finalised draft of the beech paper and ....
    - All the models and code can be found in a interactive \"science communication\" website here: <https://www.ssnhub.com/invasive-species-modelling/>
    - Simple mixed models fitted in the first chapter are explained here <https://www.ssnhub.com/beech-anova-simple/>
    - Complex Bayesian outputs overlayed on the raw data are here: <https://www.ssnhub.com/beech-complex-outputs/>

-   This work now takes on a unique twist by combining computational frameworks used in computer programming and IT development (GIT and GitHub version control) to produce interactive online books for each set of analysis (and supporting methodological references) in each chapter or publication.
    - For example: In the first chapter we fitted both mixed models in both a frequentist and Bayesian framework. They are now reproducible, online resources that I have generated from the same underlying code written for the manuscript.

- Chapter 3 is within this structure too with currently at least two very interesting questions that can be developed from this work already:
    - Effect of CR estimates on process models\...
    - Effects of varying possum control in NZ mixed forests\...

- Chapter 4 will develop depending on development with other manuscript contributions and comments. This could also be a detailed description of the reproducible approach that could be implimented on a large scale (using software already applied above; namely - Docker and github)

I have worked huge hours over the past year at the cost of everything else in the hope to get up to speed as well as staying true to seeing the true value in this reproducible "ideal" I have set. I would not have been able to do any of this without your support and guidance on the other aspects of the PhD over the past year. I am not sure I have framed this correctly but I think it is a good spin to the work I do.

#### Please comment on any issues or concerns that have hampered your progress, or may affect completion of your research

Financial pressure is always an issue for finalising PhD candidates. In my case, without the 1month internship I have organized, I do not believe I would be able to finish this PhD due to financial ties in NZ.

I understand my commitments to other projects has the potential to affect my progress as it has before (see comments)- the outcome is beginning able to demonstrate the ability to generate an idea and follow it through to production (I stopped being heavily engaged with the development of this in 2018 when I was put on academic probation) and has now been running for another year without my engagement.

I acknowledge that I have often looked as though my focus has been on other problems that are not associated with my PhD. I do not believe this is entirely true, but I understand that I need to keep on top of it during the next 6months.

I would also like to note that it could look like I was \"going down rabbit holes\" from the outside because\....

when someone is trying to create a piece of unique and ground-breaking scientific research the definition itself means that very few people could understand the concept until the PhD candidate provided enough \"proof\" or \"evidence\" that the proposed breakthrough was sound? More often than it, it isn't.

I think this may be highlighted during my PhD candidature, as I have been following both Ecological literature and general reproducibility literature for over 2 years now and these two chains of literature do not seem to overlap as often as they should.

#### Please provide a timetable for the remaining work in your program, giving a brief description of each stage

Without the reproducible workflow I have developed I acknowledge that this is not timeline would not be possible. I believe that all the background models and the underlying framework I have modified means that fitting and publishing Bayesian Hierarchical Models is much less time consuming at ever before. I do not believe this would have been possible without the adoption of the State-Space framework that we are now using and a focus on reproducible research through open science platforms such as the OSF and more universal platforms such as Github.

| Dates | Tasks | Notes|
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Nov 2019 | comments on reproducibility paper | Working on this in conjunction with first and final thesis chapters around the value of computational reproducibility at a national scale like PFNZ2050 |
| Nov-Dec 2019 |finish beech draft - send to nz| This is very very late sorry |
| Dec - Jan 2020 | MPD models | Richard and mostly Richard has made amazing progress on this already. I am adding to this currently and working on manuscript |
| Jan - Feb 2020 | internship | I will be saving to cover final income needed to hand-in and I will also be working on reproducibility chapter |
| Feb - Mar 2020 | draft MPD paper1 | simulation and/or case study results? |
| Mar - April 2020 | MPD paper1 comments | ready for feedback and assessment on whether to take 6months off to hand in or not? |
| ---------- | HOPEFULLY | timeframes are optimistic at best maybe?? |
| April - May 2020 | draft MPD paper2 | case study results? |
| May - June 2020 | Introduction circulated | submit mpd paper1 |

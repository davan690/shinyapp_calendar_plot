On 18 January 2003, the [Canberra bushfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_bushfires_of_2003 "Canberra bushfires of 2003") largely destroyed the [Mount Stromlo Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Stromlo_Observatory "Mount Stromlo Observatory").[\[21\]](#cite_note-21) ANU astronomers now conduct research from the [Siding Spring Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siding_Spring_Observatory "Siding Spring Observatory"), which contains 10 telescopes including the [Anglo-Australian Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Australian_Telescope "Anglo-Australian Telescope").[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)

In February 2013, financial entrepreneur and ANU graduate Graham Tuckwell made the largest university donation in Australian history by giving $50 million to fund an undergraduate scholarship program at ANU.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)

ANU is well known for its history of [student activism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism "Student activism") and, in recent years, its [fossil fuel divestment campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel_divestment "Fossil fuel divestment"), which is one of the longest-running and most successful in the country.[\[24\]](#cite_note-24) The decision of the ANU Council to divest from two fossil fuel companies in 2014 was criticised by ministers in the [Abbott government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_government "Abbott government"), but defended by Vice Chancellor Ian Young, who noted:

> On divestment, it is clear we were in the right and played a truly national and international leadership role. \[...\] \[W\]e seem to have played a major role in a movement which now seems unstoppable.[\[25\]](#cite_note-25)

As of 2014 ANU still had investments in major fossil fuel companies.[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)

A survey conducted by the [Australian Human Rights Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission "Australian Human Rights Commission") in 2017 found that the ANU had the second highest incidence of sexual assault and sexual harassment.[\[27\]](#cite_note-27)[\[28\]](#cite_note-28) 3.5 per cent of respondents from the ANU reported being sexually assaulted in 2016.

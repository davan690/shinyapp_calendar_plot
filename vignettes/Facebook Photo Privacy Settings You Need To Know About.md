No, the world doesn’t care what you had for dinner last night. We don’t need to see a picture of your hotel reservation. And your cat looks the same as everyone else’s.

People post too many pictures on Facebook. Statistics suggest we upload more than 400 million photos per day. That’s just ridiculous.

Nonetheless, if you’re reading this article, you probably don’t care what I think. You just want to know how to sort out the privacy settings on your photos. As with  [everything regarding privacy on Facebook](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-vital-facebook-privacy-settings-you-should-check-right-now/), the answer isn’t immediately obvious.

In this article, we’re going to look at why photo privacy matters, then explain how you can protect your images from the eyes of strangers.

## Photo Privacy: More Important Than You Think

Keeping your photographs private – or at least  [restricted to a small group of friends](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-share-photos-videos-privately-family/)  – is more important than you think. And it’s not just because a stalker from your old high school is still fantasizing about marrying you.

Sharing photos in no longer a big deal. Whether you’re an Internet addict or just own a computer, you shouldn’t have any problem sharing your digital photos and even your old films with the world....

So, what are some pitfalls of publicly accessible photographs?

- Theft:  No, I’m not talking about identity theft. Despite the scaremongering, that’s difficult to achieve with just a photo. I’m talking about a physical burglary at your house. A picture of you on a beach, or even at a local restaurant, informs a would-be criminal that you’re not at home.
- Personal Details:  Is there a picture of your driving license on the table in the background? Have you left your email account logged in on your computer screen? Is your car’s license plate in the shot? Information like this is gold dust to cyber-criminals.
- Location:  Does your photo reveal where you are? If you’re at home, have you just revealed your home address to the world?
- Embarrassment:  Has someone posted a snap of you in a compromising position? You probably don’t want your family or your boss to see it.

## Facebook and Photo Privacy

Of course, the warnings above apply to all forms of social media. But in this article, we’re only going to focus on Facebook. How can you control who sees your images? Keep reading to find out.

### Inline Privacy Controls

Let’s start at the very beginning. Even if the privacy of your old photos is a mess, it’s time to turn over a new leaf. Let’s make sure the privacy is correct for all your new photos going forward.

When you upload a new picture to Facebook, you can use the same privacy controls as you do for regular text posts. In the lower left-hand corner of the new post box, you’ll see a drop-down menu. This menu controls who can see the post.

![Facebook Photo Privacy Settings You Need To Know About facebook new post privacy](../_resources/97c397437aa15be9de5aba4c59a30592.png)

You have six options to choose from:  Public,  Friends,  Friends except  (to exclude some people),  Specific friends,  Only me, and  Custom.

Make your selection, click on  Photo/Video  to select your snap, then select  Post.

### Old Photos

Okay, so making sure your new photos are private is quite straightforward, but what about your old photos?  [Depending on your addiction level](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/social-media-detox/), we could be talking about thousands of images.

A social media detox might sound like a punishment; but if it does, there's a really good chance you need one. Here are the signs you need a detox and how to do it.

Luckily, it is possible to change the privacy level of your old snaps. You have three methods open to you:

Individual Photos:  If you only want to modify the privacy setting of one photo, you need to locate it on your wall, in  [your Activity Log](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/see-every-like-post-comment-you-made-facebook/), or in your albums. Open the photo, and in the upper right-hand corner, you’ll see the same drop-down menu as you see when setting inline privacy. Just choose your desired audience.

                 [How to See Every Like, Post, and Comment You've Made on Facebook](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/see-every-like-post-comment-you-made-facebook/)

Facebook's Activity Log shows pretty much everything you've ever done: what you've posted, commented on, saved, and more.

![Facebook Photo Privacy Settings You Need To Know About facebook old post privacy](../_resources/afad8ed4af25aa6ba6b2e041d1a42070.png)

Albums:  If you want to change the privacy of an album, navigate to your photos page from your profile and click on  Albums. Choose the album you want to alter, click  Edit, and choose your audience. You can edit photos on a case-by-case basis in  Profile Pictures  album,  Cover Photos  album,  Mobile Uploads  album, and  Timeline Photos  album; other albums apply the same setting to all the photos within them.

Restrict Access to Everything:  If you’ve taken a laissez-faire approach to Facebook privacy in the past, you might have too many pictures and too many albums to use either of the above methods. Instead, it’s better to change the privacy settings of everything you’ve ever posted to the network. This covers your photos, but also your videos, wall posts, comments, Likes, and other content.

![Facebook Photo Privacy Settings You Need To Know About facebook limit privacy](../_resources/8cc41f59eae900a51a8eb24d74e8d9dc.png)

Go to  Settings > Privacy > Limit the audience for posts you’ve shared with friends of friends or Public  and click on  Limit past posts > Limit Old Posts  to make the changes. Anything you have shared with friends of friends or the general public will change to Friends only. The changes cannot be undone.

### Pro Tip: Use the Activity Log

For a quick way of seeing which photos are shared with the public, you can use the Activity Log. It’ll save you the time of trawling through endless albums.

Click on the  Activity Log  link from your profile page and select  Photos  in the left-hand panel.

![Facebook Photo Privacy Settings You Need To Know About facebook timeline privacy](../_resources/dc757f743cc91cf470981cc9b928be3a.png)

Next, at the top of the screen, choose  Public  in the drop-down box next to  Shared With.

You can also change the  On Timeline  drop-down box to see which content is visible on your own wall.

### Photos You’re Tagged In

Great, so that covers everything you’ve uploaded yourself, but what about photos other people have uploaded? How can you make those private?

Well, you can’t. They’re not your photos, and you don’t have control over them. But you can untag yourself.

To remove a tag, navigate to the photo in question, click on the small arrow in the upper right-hand corner, and select  Report/Remove Tags. Click  Untag  Photos  to complete the process.

Unfortunately, the photo will still be visible to other users on Facebook. As long as the image does not break the network’s  Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, there’s nothing you can do. If you feel the image is abusive, you click on the  Report  link to let Facebook know. If the company agrees, it will remove the photo.

### Tag Suggestions

You can’t prevent other people from tagging you in photos, but you can stop your name being shown to them when they upload a photo. It means when someone uploads a photo, Facebook will not suggest your name to them as a recommended tag, even if it recognizes that the image looks like you.

To restrict tagging recommendations, go to  Settings > Timeline and Tagging > Who sees tag suggestions when photos that look like you are uploaded  and change the setting to  No one.

![Facebook Photo Privacy Settings You Need To Know About facebook untag](../_resources/69efab95d49c05c01ee6f659fa70f30c.png)

While you’re in the  Timeline and Tagging  settings, it’s also worth changing  Review posts that friends tag you in before they appear on your timeline to  On. It means no images will suddenly appear on your profile’s timeline without your authorization.

## Does Photo Privacy Concern You?

I hope this article has both made you realize photo privacy is important and helped you to understand the steps you can take to ensure images of you aren’t accidentally in the public realm.

Let’s quickly summarize:

- Edit the privacy of new photos using the inline audience selector
- Edit old pictures by using the Activity Log or by changing the privacy of individual images or albums
- Untag yourself from friends’ photos
- Change tagging settings for new photos

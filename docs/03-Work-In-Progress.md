*Creating timeline charts in R (Generating Timeline charts)*



We will use *ggplot* function from *ggplot2* package to generate timeline charts. The following functions are used to add layers of details to the chart. Workout timeline with a heat-map of calories burnt with activity type

Timeline charts can be used in a lot of applications like tracking equipment or a process status changes, resource availability & scheduling, project timelines, documenting start and end times of events. The beauty of ggplot2 package is that the code can be easily customized, and more details can be added to the plots.

To do this I have created a calendar for each key project/impact/aspect of short-term timeline, objectives, as well as, my career and life projection. To begin with I need to create timelines and other project goals under covid19. I have put this into a single dataset called `dat` here.

These figures can be generated using `ggplot` and other `tidyverse` approaches due to the implantation of the `dataspice` packages above.

# 
# ## Remove some observations so we have an incomplete data set

# 
# ## Make a data frame with a full series of dates from the min date to the max date
# ## in the incomplete data frame
# full_dates <- seq(min(my_incomplete_data$date), max(my_incomplete_data$date), 
#                   by = "1 month")
# full_dates <- data.frame(date = full_dates)
# 
# ## Merge the complete data frame with the incomplete to fill in the dates and add 
# ## NAs for missing values
# my_complete_data <- merge(full_dates, my_incomplete_data, by = "date", 
#                           all.x = TRUE)

# NOT RUN {
## locale-specific version of the date
# format(Sys.Date(), "%a %b %d")
# }
# NOT RUN {
## read in date info in format 'ddmmmyyyy'
## This will give NA(s) in some locales; setting the C locale
## as in the commented lines will overcome this on most systems.
## lct <- Sys.getlocale("LC_TIME"); Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "C")
# x <- c("1jan1960", "2jan1960", "31mar1960", "30jul1960")
# z <- as.Date(x, "%d%b%Y")
## Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", lct)
# z

## read in date/time info in format 'm/d/y'
# dates <- c("02/27/92", "02/27/92", "01/14/92", "02/28/92", "02/01/92")
# as.Date(dates, "%m/%d/%y")

## date given as number of days since 1900-01-01 (a date in 1989)
# as.Date(32768, origin = "1900-01-01")
## Excel is said to use 1900-01-01 as day 1 (Windows default) or
## 1904-01-01 as day 0 (Mac default), but this is complicated by Excel
## incorrectly treating 1900 as a leap year.
## So for dates (post-1901) from Windows Excel
# as.Date(35981, origin = "1899-12-30") # 1998-07-05
## and Mac Excel
# as.Date(34519, origin = "1904-01-01") # 1998-07-05
## (these values come from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214330)

## Experiment shows that Matlab's origin is 719529 days before ours,
## (it takes the non-existent 0000-01-01 as day 1)
## so Matlab day 734373 can be imported as
# as.Date(734373, origin = "1970-01-01") - 719529 # 2010-08-23
## (value from
## http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/matlab/matlab_prog/represent-date-and-times-in-MATLAB.html)

## Time zone effect
# z <- ISOdate(2010, 04, 13, c(0,12)) # midnight and midday UTC
# as.Date(z) # in UTC
# }
# NOT RUN {
# ## these time zone names are common
# as.Date(z, tz = "NZ")
# as.Date(z, tz = "HST") # Hawaii
# }

# set Home directory > home = setwd(Sys.getenv("HOME")); >  > # make path to the csv file > fpath = file.path(home, "Desktop", "at0901.csv"); > # read the csv file > at0901 = read.csv(fpath, header=TRUE);
```

Generally the concept is to create a baseline dataset of information and then extend this using `dataspice` to create a tidy format of data that can then be modelled and visualised using the `tidyverse` suite of tools.

```{r}
library(lubridate)
# glimpse(datBASE)
# dt <- data.frame(mon = c(10, 4), day = c(10, 4), year = c(2017, 2018))

# with(dt, ymd(paste(year, mon, day, sep = "-")))
#> [1] "2017-10-10" "2018-04-04"


### to correct ggplot subset
datBASE1 <- datBASE  %>%
    dplyr::select(startDate,month, year, milestone, status, shortName, project) %>%
                 mutate(date = as.Date(startDate, "%d/%m/%y"))
# ,
#                        month = as.numeric(as.character(month)),
#                        year = as.numeric(year),
#                        milestone = as.factor(milestone),
#                        status = as.factor(status))
# glimpse(datBASE1)
# df$date <- with(df, ymd(sprintf('%04d%02d%02d', year, month, 1)))
df <- datBASE1

# library(lubridate)
# dt <- data.frame(mon = c(10, 4), day = c(10, 4), year = c(2017, 2018))
# with(dt, ymd(paste(year, mon, day, sep = "-")))
#> [1] "2017-10-10" "2018-04-04"

# datBASE1$date <- with(datBASE1, ymd(sprintf('%04d%02d%02d', year, month, 1)))
df <- df[with(df, order(date)), ]
# head(df)
text_offset <- 0.05
```

## Data setup {.tabset}

```{r}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./img/TidyPipes-calenderJUL2020v2.png")
```

There are multiple difference sources of information for this calendar. To be able to keep this upto date and current I need to write scripts for each data-source to my database of events (here). These are the following importing scripts:

- Timeline figures:
  - Past
  - Future
  
- Actions and milestones

The purpose of this vignette is to show how, with reference to a real-world application: creating a timetable for a new module. It assumes you’ve installed the package following instructions in the README and have attached it as follows:

Overall this is time series data. A good general tutorial for this sort of data is here on [youtube]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uenWg7ZSu4Y"). There are several ways to visualise this data, below are two selected bits of code that do this. Overall there are two generalised datasets that may be helpful to other individuals for each project or combination of projects (for the APR for example). The data for this collection of tasks associated with timelines and targets. The baseline dataset is found in the `.xlsx` file named "baseline-dataset-calender.xlsx". This is the base file I have been adding information to when I change the overall structure of the calendar projects.

### Manual data

To begin with I have collated and restructured the avaliable data from downloaded `.ics` data as a csv and the UCSRC council calendar. This sorted data was orginally saved as "baseline-dataset-calender.xlsx" but as I couldnt get the xcel package to work nicely I converted each project dataset into a csv file stored in the `./data/` folder.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
list.files("./data/")
```

### Baseline

```{r}
source("./R/importDATAscript.R", echo = FALSE)

DT::datatable(head(datBASE))

#incorperate milestones 
# source(here::here("./vignettes/milestonesfromdataframe.Rmd"), local = TRUE,opts_knit(rmarkdown.html_vignette.check_title = FALSE))
# vignette("./vignettes/milestones-from-dataframe.html")
```


### `.xlsx`

These are excel workbooks. For now this is very simple and works with the current version of excel files (2020). Each "sheet" of the excel file contains a single projects information. This is then converted to a csv file when needed. In the future each project will have its own file that can be added to or modified in a shiny interactive web app.

```{r}
#excel read

#number of sheets in project currently


## Saved as csv's and imported as so below...
```

> A key aspect of these R scripts is the date format. This has been challenging to work with but currently I have the following notes on the transformation of the date/time data from excel and manually (with csv file below).

### `.csv`

Generally the data can be imported as a csv, or other form. 

```{r}
library(readr)
emailsCalender1 <- read_csv("data/raw_data/anuemails.CSV")
#str(emailsCalender1)
```

### `.iCal` data

```{r}
#this currently online
```

### Other data

Bernd and others have made timelines in R using the following R script:

```{r}

```

Aspects of this simple timeline are incoperated as so:

```{r}

```

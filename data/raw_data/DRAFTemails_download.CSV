			This is disappointing – but rather common to have a first paper knocked back, so please don’t become disheartened.  It would be good to think about how we deal with the comments of the editor and re-submit elsewhere.

"","Dear Reseacher,
 
The general concept is to build a statistical support network across the university, for researchers, by researchers. (Note: I am using the term researchers in its most inclusive form which includes HDR students).
1. I will be running statistical support drop-ins from 1-3pm every Thursday in 1C153 where my primary role will be to listen to and direct researchers to where they can get appropriate help. I will be suggesting a range of offline and online resources and can give basic statistical advice myself as well as support in my particular areas of expertise. I will also facilitate some small group training courses based on demand and have access to DataCamp tutorials to add to the suite of support options on offer.
2. For those who need more specialised statistical help or research design advice, I hope to draw on the experience and expertise within the network (which I hope you will agree to be part of). In these cases, I will identify volunteers with suitable skillsets and contact them with details about what support is needed. I will only direct researchers to volunteers when I have been granted permission (by the volunteer) to do so.
3. If you agree to be part of the network there is no minimum time commitment required. It is my intention to be flexible and utilise the extensive skills of those who volunteer but not to burden them with a set number of hours on top of already high research and teaching loads. Any consultations will be arranged on a case-by-case basis by me at times that suit individual volunteers.
Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I would love to meet you for a coffee or chat to discuss how this could be improved and to get a better understanding in the areas that you would like to work in more precisely. And <http://precisely. And>  to be honest, talking about statistics is heaps of fun.
Thanks for your support and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Anthony

Subject: RE: SEF progress
 
Hi SRC Members,
 
Thank you to Keisha and Mriginka for your questions. There are two main issues here which your questions seek to address:
1)      What financial support might be available to international students through UC, including access to funding held within the Student Empowerment Fund; and
2)      Whether the SRC would be able to direct funds into the Student Empowerment Fund for that purpose.
 
The Student Representative Council’s funding, as you know, is SSAF monies and there are strict controls over what it can be spent on and how it needs to be accounted for at the end of each year. The University is required to certify each year that SSAF monies were spent in compliance with these requirements and any breach can see the University penalised.
 
Eligible purposes for SSAF expenditure are limited to the following and need to occur within the year that the funds were collected as far as possible:
*         Providing food or drink to students on a campus of the higher education provider;
*         supporting a sporting or other recreational activity by students;
*         supporting the administration of a club most of whose members are students;
*         caring for children of students;
*         providing legal services to students;
*         promoting the health or welfare of students;
*         helping students secure accommodation;
*         helping students obtain employment or advice on careers;
*         helping students with their financial affairs;
*         helping students obtain insurance against personal accidents;
*         supporting debating by students;
*         providing libraries and reading rooms (other than those provided for academic purposes) for students;
*         supporting an artistic activity by students;
*         supporting the production and dissemination to students of media whose content is provided by students;
*         helping students develop skills for study, by means other than undertaking courses of study in which they are enrolled;
*         advising on matters arising under the higher education provider's rules (however described);
*         advocating students' interests in matters arising under the higher education provider's rules (however described);
*         giving students information to help them in their orientation; and
*         helping meet the specific needs of overseas students relating to their welfare, accommodation and employment.
 
Of the permissible purposes, there are very few on the list that align to the purposes of the Student Empowerment Fund which “is available to students who are experiencing unexpected financial hardship. It consists of a one-off bursary to contribute towards immediate, short-term needs including basic living and medical costs.” 
 
Further to this, any contribution of SSAF monies to the Student Empowerment Fund may cause those staff operating it to hold that money separately to ensure that it can only be spend in line with SSAF requirements and to account for its expenditure separately. As such, while this may be technically possible with some effort, it may create significant challenges to the administration of the Student Empowerment Fund. As such, I would not recommend this approach going forward.
 
As far as international students being able to access the funds held in the Student Empowerment Fund, this is already happening. Access to the Student Empowerment Fund is managed by the Student Welfare office and, as I understand it, students who are in financial crisis may be given grocery vouchers or other small amounts of money to address short term critical need. I also understand that these payments are typically once off. I would strongly encourage the SRC to direct any student in serious financial trouble to contact the Student Welfare office for assistance.
 
Any other questions you have regarding the Student Empowerment Fund and its operation are probably best directed to Mr Scott Pearsall, Dean of Students and Director – Student Life in the first instance. 
 
In relation to how the SRC may be able to support students in need, it is important to return to your rules and to the bid for funding that was approved late in 2019. I do not see within the SRC Rules at sections 2 (Role) or 3 (Functions) anything which suggests that the SRC should be seeking to financially support students directly nor does your funding bid provide a basis for this to occur. Any change to the purpose for which your received SSAF funds were given will require a proposal to go through an approval process for it to be repurposed. 
 
As a result, your available options to be able to redirect your funding to students for financial support appear to be:
1.       Voluntarily return some of your allocated SSAF monies for this year to the general pot for reallocation by the University; or
2.       Prepare a proposal to go to the Vice-President Financial and Infrastructure seeking to repurpose some of the SSAF monies you hold for a specified purpose.
 
I hope this assists you to consider how SRC funds may be best directed to supporting students in need.
 
Kind regards,
 
Brad.

Hi Sarah, 
 
Thanks for getting back to us. 
 
We understand the requirements of us spending money. 
 
Adding to Mriganka’s email, we are wondering what the SEF will be used for and if there is a reason it hasn’t be been made available to students yet? 
 
The reason we are asking, is we are hoping that some of this funding will be made available to our international students. 
 
We know that the international students who remain here in Australia do not have access to any government funding and many are without jobs. We are hoping to that the SRC might be able to assist in helping these students. 
 
Do you have any suggestions on how we may be able to effectively do this? Do you know if the university has anything in the works? 
 
Look forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter. 
 
Many thanks, 
Keisha

Subject: RE: SEF progress
 
Hi All
 
Thank you for this generous thought.
 
I will look further into the SEF however we also need to look at the requirements of SSAF. Im presently reading into it and in general the SEF meets the guidelines (would need to be spent this year and would need to be accounted for) however I wonder if there may be another approach the SRC could take to support students. 
Have you had a look at what other SRC’s are doing to support students?  
Are there supports that could be implemented in Sem 2 once we are back on campus?

Dear Sarah and Brad, 
 
Hope you're both keeping well.
 
I had a meeting with the Diversity Team recently (Keisha, Dian and I) and we were considering donating some of the SRC's funds towards the Student Empowerment Fund. For this, I would like to know about the progress of the SEF, if this information is known to you. 
 
Questions we had included:
 
1.	Are we waiting for a certain target to be reached before we start making it accessible to international students? 
2.	How much has been raised so far?
3.	Can the SRC allocate a significant amount of our now reduced yearly budget towards this? 
I would really appreciate your help on this! 
 
Cheers
 
Mriganka

"General mentorship","Dear Belinda,
 
Hope all is well and managing to get some downtime since the VC’s appointment. I am contacting you in regard to support for the management decisions and positions in this current environment. 
 
Over the past 4 months on council I have observed several key processes and procedures that I would like to see strengthen (or at least my understanding of them). I have become awake that some of these issues are pushed under the table by upper management and disregarded by middle management. I don’t have a problem with this process “per-say” but the work I am doing in reproducibility and transparency are leading the global fight against Covid19 and the current research environment. I also think that some of the things I am experiencing are a result of different communication styles and content between the different levels of structure throughout the university.
 
Would you be interested in having a casual discussion with me in regard to some of these ideas in the context of UC as I continue to develop these documents and subsequent support/lack of.
 
Totally understand if you are too busy.
Thanks for your time.

Hi All,
 
Marketing will be driving the communications to student from the University and will likely talk to you about that in relation to informing students about the supports available to students, including international students, which has been a topic of much discussion amongst you.
 
In so far as survey design and analysis, I don’t believe that Marketing are doing that but I am not 100% sure. I guess I am saying, don’t be surprised if Andy tells you that they aren’t doing survey design and analysis and she is there to talk about communications about available support.

No one has any questions they'd like raised? 
 
In addition to Brad's email earlier, please remember that marketing will be attending to discuss how they are communicating with Students. 
 
If there is something you would like answers on, now is the time so we can ensure they come to the meeting prepared to answer rather than them needing to get back to us.

"Situation","Good Morning all,
 
I hope everyone is ok. Happy to chat if anyone would like too.
 
On the current note on the early release of exam info. Before Scott, Lawrence, Sarah and Brad “fix” the problem the SRC is being blamed for but that management created and we all deal with this hands on in our respective student communities I would like to make it very obvious that a collection of SRC members and I believe on several occasions unanimously agreed on the importance of transparency and assurance for the student community. This has been REPEATEDLY brought up at all levels of governance BELOW Scott and Lawrence.
 
I cannot express how disappointed I am in the executive management at this time. 
 
My focus (as a student representative) is to communicate what is needed for the student body and my focus at this time is not in the short coming of management and there help is much needed from my prospective. However, if it is any reassurance to SRC members, as SRC, if we come to a consensus at any point that these issues are not being addressed in an adequate or timely manner I am willing to present a collective summary from the SRC of the student situation to council in a closed session. 
 
As for today, happy to do whatever is needed. I am happy to build surveys etc if we want to understand this but I would like to have any of these surveys check for these sorts of possible issues before posted anywhere. I believe some structure around the removal of posts and comments from members of the SRC fb etc pages is important. 
 
From a management prospective I think we need to filter and directly manage comments like yesterdays ones before they become a comment feed of over 100 replies. It looks really bad that there are not much engagement until this….ie this is an issue 
 
Do we have a set of guidelines that would be appropriate as conduct and removal conditions on these pages other than the standard fb choices?
 
I would also recommend that we have SRC meeting today  and maybe a closed (only students) meeting to get everyone upto speed. I am happy to put something in and set it up if that helps Hamish?

Thanks Anthony
I have included Jen Webb and Melica Symul for the research questions you asked.
 
The TEQSA FAQs provide a good check list for us to use to ensure we covering TEQSA requirements and also engaging with the student body in an effective manner. Scott can follow up on this one. 
I am also keen to make sure we continue the dialogue with students about how we respond to the changes caused by the Covid19 situation. As we plan for semester 2 and gradually coming back onto campus, I think it would be good to have specific sessions with the SRC to go over options and restrictions we may have as part of this transition. Again, Scott can work on this one. 
 
We have a badging system in place for some things, so Lyndon might be able to provide details on this as I am not sure whether our current system is the sort of thing you are envisioning?

Dear Geoff and Scott, 
 
Thank you very much for all your hard work. 
 
With reference to your previous email, I was referring to the new FAQs page https://www.teqsa.gov.au/frequently-asked-questions-faqs <https://www.teqsa.gov.au/frequently-asked-questions-faqs>   they have that is pretty simple. Did you see that? Even this page (https://www.teqsa.gov.au/information-students <https://www.teqsa.gov.au/information-students>  
) is much older than the FAQ page and the other pages are far more complex. When I spoke to the site manager over the phone at TEQSA a few days ago she explained to me that they were in the process of developing this further but could put the new links it at top of page….I thought this was a pretty cryptic insight into the situation.
 
More generally, I am beginning to see some really positive impacts from my prospective on council but there is a long way to go to get to a transparent workflow between management and students. I am beginning to notice other universities are applying the concepts and framework of reproducible research and this why I have highlighted this. Particularly with reference to Paddy’s interest in university rankings.
 
Many of my resources/approach come from a working group called the R Open Science framework (OSF https://osf.io/ <https://osf.io/> ). Some of the work this group did in 2016-2018 was to investigate and propose a set of reproducibility guidelines and accompanying badge scheme https://www.cos.io/badges <https://www.cos.io/badges> . Have you heard about this and what the development of this is from your prospective? I have a huge number of resources supporting both the difficultly of implementing a badge like scheme and tools in R to implement these. 
 
I notice now that the following Journals use these badges (list at bottom of email). Are other researchers around UC using any badging system? What about a badging system for community engagement?
 
I am very interested in your thoughts on these in the context of the UC environment?
 
I also noted yesterday that UC got one of the bigger sport development grants they were looking for. Is there any reproducible framework behind this project to make it scalable quickly. 
 
For example, can UC research provide solutions for the Brumbies to get back to playing footy but then can also be sold or development with the rest of the league teams? 
 
These sorts of quick response projects could be really positive for UC. I notice most of the grant money I have seen come in have been for longer term development projects but have I missed something?
 
Thank you for your time,
 
Anthony

The TEQSA website is very useful we certainly use the TEQSA Guidance Notes (https://www.teqsa.gov.au/guidance-notes <https://www.teqsa.gov.au/guidance-notes> ) To inform our practices at UC. 
 
We have the Learning and Teaching Unit that has expertise in online education and they have been running a significant numb er of workshops, information sessions and dropins for staff as they moved to remote teaching and assessment. 
 
There are a large number of resources on all sorts of topics that may be of relevance and interest to the SRC. We probably need some priority ordering so as to not overwhelm SRC members with information.

Dear Geoff,
 
I made this and the transparency issues addressing UC 13 days ago, with particular reference to this article https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/20/03/providing-stability-time-crisis <https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/20/03/providing-stability-time-crisis> . Just wondering what your response to this and if you have better resources?
 
I have investigated rules and regulations earlier this morning under TEQSA website and found a series I will follow And the resource page. TEQSA, in collaboration with RMIT, invites you to a new weekly webinar series discussing all things online learning. https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/getting-started-best-practice-for-establishing-online-learning-tickets-103760343982 <https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/getting-started-best-practice-for-establishing-online-learning-tickets-103760343982> 
 
As well as a very good student help page: https://www.teqsa.gov.au/information-students <https://www.teqsa.gov.au/information-students> 
 
1.	Did you know about these?
2.	Are they a good resource for the SRC as I have had no guidance on this?
3.	Why is the SRC not receiving this sort of transparency?
 
And these are not only problems at UC I might add…..Canberra Times reported about the current COvid19 education arrangements with public schools and the “secret-deal” on the 30th April. Opposition Leader Alistair Coe said.

“It should be scientific evidence that is guiding the decisions but, unfortunately, due to a lack of transparency with the ACT Government, there is a growing suspicion that it is the union that is dictating the government’s response,”

"RE: Current issues","Dear Jen,
 
Thank you for this. I have been aware of the badging framework proposed several years ago in the plus one program. However, this badge program didn’t seem to take full advantage of the current developments in open-source science and reproducible resources. 
 
Since I last saw a very early draft of this document (I think) several key developments in the following research and implementation has happened. I think that it would be very positive to this program to incorporate these dynamics.
 
Mainly the library interns the USA unis have done like:

We are considering instituting a badging system for HDR candidates when the new PhD is in place. We will be in touch with the SRC about that, probably early next year.

Thanks Anthony
I have included Jen Webb and Melica Symul for the research questions you asked.
The TEQSA FAQs provide a good check list for us to use to ensure we covering TEQSA requirements and also engaging with the student body in an effective manner. Scott can follow up on this one. 
I am also keen to make sure we continue the dialogue with students about how we respond to the changes caused by the Covid19 situation. As we plan for semester 2 and gradually coming back onto campus, I think it would be good to have specific sessions with the SRC to go over options and restrictions we may have as part of this transition. Again, Scott can work on this one. 
 
We have a badging system in place for some things, so Lyndon might be able to provide details on this as I am not sure whether our current system is the sort of thing you are envisioning?

Geoff

Subject: Re: Current issues
 
Dear Geoff and Scott, 
 
Thank you very much for all your hard work. 
 
With reference to your previous email, I was referring to the new FAQs page https://www.teqsa.gov.au/frequently-asked-questions-faqs <https://www.teqsa.gov.au/frequently-asked-questions-faqs>   they have that is pretty simple. Did you see that? Even this page (https://www.teqsa.gov.au/information-students <https://www.teqsa.gov.au/information-students>  
) is much older than the FAQ page and the other pages are far more complex. When I spoke to the site manager over the phone at TEQSA a few days ago she explained to me that they were in the process of developing this further but could put the new links it at top of page….I thought this was a pretty cryptic insight into the situation.
 
More generally, I am beginning to see some really positive impacts from my prospective on council but there is a long way to go to get to a transparent workflow between management and students. I am beginning to notice other universities are applying the concepts and framework of reproducible research and this why I have highlighted this. Particularly with reference to Paddy’s interest in university rankings.
 
Many of my resources/approach come from a working group called the R Open Science framework (OSF https://osf.io/ <https://osf.io/> ). Some of the work this group did in 2016-2018 was to investigate and propose a set of reproducibility guidelines and accompanying badge scheme https://www.cos.io/badges <https://www.cos.io/badges> . Have you heard about this and what the development of this is from your prospective? I have a huge number of resources supporting both the difficultly of implementing a badge like scheme and tools in R to implement these. 
 
I notice now that the following Journals use these badges (list at bottom of email). Are other researchers around UC using any badging system? What about a badging system for community engagement?
 
I am very interested in your thoughts on these in the context of the UC environment?
 
I also noted yesterday that UC got one of the bigger sport development grants they were looking for. Is there any reproducible framework behind this project to make it scalable quickly. 
 
For example, can UC research provide solutions for the Brumbies to get back to playing footy but then can also be sold or development with the rest of the league teams? 
 
These sorts of quick response projects could be really positive for UC. I notice most of the grant money I have seen come in have been for longer term development projects but have I missed something?
 
Thank you for your time,
 
Anthony

Subject: Current issues
 
Dear Geoff,
 
I made this and the transparency issues addressing UC 13 days ago, with particular reference to this article https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/20/03/providing-stability-time-crisis <https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/20/03/providing-stability-time-crisis> . Just wondering what your response to this and if you have better resources?
 
I have investigated rules and regulations earlier this morning under TEQSA website and found a series I will follow And the resource page. TEQSA, in collaboration with RMIT, invites you to a new weekly webinar series discussing all things online learning. https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/getting-started-best-practice-for-establishing-online-learning-tickets-103760343982 <https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/getting-started-best-practice-for-establishing-online-learning-tickets-103760343982> 
 
As well as a very good student help page: https://www.teqsa.gov.au/information-students <https://www.teqsa.gov.au/information-students> 
 
1.	Did you know about these?
2.	Are they a good resource for the SRC as I have had no guidance on this?
3.	Why is the SRC not receiving this sort of transparency?
 
And these are not only problems at UC I might add…..Canberra Times reported about the current COvid19 education arrangements with public schools and the “secret-deal” on the 30th April. Opposition Leader Alistair Coe said.

“It should be scientific evidence that is guiding the decisions but, unfortunately, due to a lack of transparency with the ACT Government, there is a growing suspicion that it is the union that is dictating the government’s response,”

That sounds great Terry, yes it will still be relevant!   The ""older"" outlines are still the same subjects/ relevant....I just had the students try to modify their plans, make them clearer by focusing their questions more and then adding details about their experiment.

Really nice to meet you, and I look forward to meeting you someday soon! Please speak up during the workshop about anything. I look forward to a great discussion. 
 
Rachael, I briefly looked over the new versions, but since I was busy all morning, I'll keep the slides as I wrote them yesterday. Hopefully, they'll still be relevant.

Hi Terry and Rachael,
 
What a great start. They look like awesome students. I have meetings most of the morning but I will do my best to have a better scan before session today.
 
Hi Terry,
 
I am not sure if you remember me? It feels a bit weird to me because I have seen a few sections of your code using tidyverse (dplyr and ggplot2) with some of the Health Students at UC and I loved it (I even managed extend some of the plots within a few mins). Thank you so much for this. But I am not sure I have ever meet you in person.
 
I hope its ok to follow along and learn some of your approaches etc. I have been so humbled by some of the students you have supported with such high demand.
 
Regards,
Anthony

Hi Terry and Anthony,
 
Three of my students have just submitted revised outlines of their experimental plans this morning.  They are at the beginning stage of generating ideas for their research....and plan on developing their plan over the month.  Two of them made a short powerpoint!  The files are on wattle in the new folder, but I also included them here for you to take a quick look at before class.
 
Also- Terry, I asked a colleague to join us - Anthony Davidson from University of Canberra.  I think you have already met (?) or worked with each other's students.  Anthony has just started helping me work with my Masters students to share his knowledge of biology/exp design/stats as well.

Just sending through a hard copy of the document we were working on yesterday in our group. Thank you all so much for your contributions. If you would like to add anything to the group …. That would be kol.
 
I was just going to add that I think we were on the right track and it would be good to adding references etc… to add a bit of depth to the information. I have added a few references here to get you started if it helps. 
 
I haven’t finished added the code to extract the plots through the statistical program I use (RStudio) but happy to send through that info to anyone who is interested.
 
Have a good day. ??

I am sorry I have been so behind on all of this. I really don’t know what my options are but I have attached a detailed timeline, proposal and deadlines for submission by the end of the year. 
 
Given the current covid19 conditions I think it may be fair to fund this with an APA 6month extension. I feel as though this is well out of my knowledge currently. Maybe you would know what I should do as a next step?

Hi Mr Cameron & Anthony,
As a courtesy we inform you that the below recurring maintenance request regarding the below property is due to reoccur. You will be contacted by the relevant trade supplier in the near future to arrange for it to be addressed.
Property address: 
10/271 Antill Street, Watson, ACT 2602
Brief Description:
$99 Smoke Alarm Compliance Subscription - Contract
Details: 
As a Landlord you have a duty of care to your tenants across a number of areas. One of these legislated requirements is the installation and maintenance of smoke alarms in your rental property. Legislation mandates that it is the responsibility of the owner of a residential property to ensure that smoke alarms are installed in the premises and kept in working order in accordance with Australian Standard 1993 /AS 3786 and the Building Code of Australia part 3.7.2.

We take compliance issues very seriously and highly recommend that you register your property to be inspected by Smoke Alarms Australia. Their $99 all-inclusive subscription program ensures 100% compliance when it comes to your responsibilities as a landlord and is Tax Deductible!
Date: 
{Undefined tag: maintreq_reqdate}

Dear Anthony,
 
Thanks for your email.
 
We got info from ORACLE Java that the JRE version installed on the PC are no longer free & not sure how long the vendor would allow users to use paid licensed software without paying fees! Therefore, It would be great if you could discover ASAP the possibility to replace the JRE plugin by OpenJDK (open source – free.)
 
In case users really need to keep ORACLE JRE on their PCs for work, it would be great to get approval from their managers and or their faculty’s division’s authorities.
 
P/S: DITM have been converting our Student SOE to use OpenJDK instead of the costly JRE plugin and we have been successfully doing for some software…
 
Thanks

Yes I use it for building shiny applications for my data analysis. But I am not an expert so maybe you could explain how best to setup this pipeline without it.

Dear Anthony,
 
I hope you are well.
 
Due to recent software licensing changes to the Java Runtime Environment (plug-in), it is no longer free for educational use. DITM are currently conducting an audit, your following PC has been identified as one that currently has Java installed.
 
DITM will soon begin removing Java from staff machines, unless of course you require it. In most cases Java isn’t used directly, but is often used by other software. Some examples are; Callista admin users and Ascender admin users.
 
If you believe you still require Java, please let us know. Or if you are unsure if you require it, please reply to this email.
 
Kind regards,

"Population modelling course","Dear Kevin Shoemaker,
 
My name is Anthony Davidson and I am a PhD candidate at the University of Canberra in Australia. I have focused my research on population modelling and have been using your course with other students and my own personal research.
 
I just wanted to to say thank you very much for posting this on github. I think that your course is amazing and a great set of resources for building the deeper foundations of population modelling.
 
I was wondering if it is ok if I started using this resource more heavily and extend on it for my future courses and teaching? Would love to discuss over zoom sometime if you have time?
 
I have been working with Professor…. Book on eniveromental statistics and was hoping to merge these two resources to begin the foundations of my teaching resources. I totally understand if you are not comfortable with this

Subject: University of Canberra College - Redundancies
 
Dear Colleagues, 
 
I just wanted to provide a heads-up on news of redundancies at University Canberra College. The details are included below as provided by Vicki who sits on the Board.  
 
UCC is a seperate entity so this is not a Council matter per se. But the UC reputation is and the association with UC means we need to keep a watching eye on these developments. 
 
It is our current understanding that there is no knock on impacts for staff at UC and, since this is a seperate entity, no Council/University related decisions to be considered. However, I felt it important to let you know of the changes at UCC given the association with the UC brand and reputation. And to assure you that we are monitoring this closely and that we will keep council appraised as and when necessary. I am happy to take questions or calls ay any time on this if helpful.
 
On a positive note - 600+ staff joined our Town Hall yesterday for an update on covid impact and progress. We continue to receive positive feedback about the openness and transparency of our engagement with staff. We certainly have challenges but the senior team and the staff continue to impress me with the manner in which they are working together to face these challenges. 
 
Have a wonderful long weekend.
 
Kind regards
 
Paddy

UC College – Summary of Change Proposal
 
As a result of COVID-19, the University of Canberra College (UCC) has forecast a 30% reduction in revenue for 2020. UCC have determined through efforts to reduce non-staffing related costs (such as a reduction in marketing budget, miscellaneous expenses, deferred rent) that they will be unable to meet the forecast loss. To meet this challenge, UCC have proposed the following changes which will have a direct impact on some UCC staff.
 
1.	Redundancies:
	a.	Director of Marketing and Admissions
	b.	Director of Student and Academic Services
	c.	Student and Academic Services Officer
2.	Temporarily reducing hours:
	a.	Quality and Compliance Manager (from 1FTE to 0.5FTE)
3.	Changes in staff reporting lines in recognition of redundant positions
4.	Recruitment freeze on new and replacement positions
UCC expects the crisis will impact the organisation significantly for the next 9-12 months and have identified the above actions as ensuring the long-term sustainability of their business model.
Consultation under Section 28 of the UCC Enterprise Agreement closed 20 May and this feedback is currently under consideration.
 
The UCC Board meets to consider again on 28 May 2020.

Hi everyone,
 
After last week, I realize that I only need 5 of you to demonstrate this week in both classes since we only had 5 student groups to deliver presentations in each class. 
 
All I need for this week is:
 
Ivan, Upama, Putter, Alyssa and Renzo
Thurs 9-11am
Fri 12-2pm
 
We can have our demonstration meeting on Wed 3 June 10am-11am, since that time worked for everyone.  Please look at the first 3 documents I have posted on wattle under ""Final Synthesis: Week 11 & 12"" before the meeting (instructions, rubric and BIOL6201 tasks).
Topic: BIOL3201 demo meeting
Time: Jun 3, 2020 10:00 AM Canberra

Meeting ID: 920 2489 4378
 
I could use help with marking the last assignments from the rest of you (Karl, Anthony, Pallavi, Ary- as well as Putter, Ivan and Upama) if you have time (this will all be during your own time-  marking writing pieces- Critical Thinking Piece 2 (600 words due this week) and the Final Writing Piece (1000 words, due 17 June).
 
Thank you

Subject: Big Questions demonstrating this week 
 
For our BIOL3201 Big Questions workshop this week (28/29 May), I only need Upama and Ivan to attend the workshops.  The students are mostly just going to be preparing/researching on their own for their oral presentations that they will deliver next week (4 and 5 June).  The main help I need this week is with the Masters students (BIOL6201)- I will just be going through strategies/tutorial with them about how to be a ""demonstrator"" and use the marking rubric as a guide.  Upama and Ivan can both help me with those students and/or fielding other questions as undergraduate students go through their research (popping in and out of rooms).
 
For their ""question"" that will be the subject for both their oral presentation and their final writing assignment- I'm incorporating Susan Howitt's lecture from Monday 25 May of the ""nature of science"" and applying it to climate change.  I decided I will just ask all of them to research the same question, as it will be easier to manage, especially if the groups happen to change slightly for their final oral presentation next week (if one gets sick, have to change days, etc).  I’ll send the documents to all of you tomorrow afternoon/evening!
 
I want to have a demonstrator meeting next week, before our workshop, so we can all discuss the logistics of the oral presentations, etc.  
Are you available for a zoom demonstrator meeting on Tuesday 2 June at 11am?
I'm basically free most of Tuesday, so I could meet at another time, or I'm free Wed 3 June  10am-11am. Please can you let me know your availability so I can schedule a meeting for all of us.  
 
Thanks!
Rachael

Subject: Oral presentations for Big Questions class BIOL3201 (warning LONG email!) 
 
Hello demonstrators,
The student final presentations will be in a couple weeks, June 4 and 5.  
 
Could I get confirmation from all of you if you are able to attend both workshops?
Thurs 4 June 9am-11am
Friday 5 June 12pm-2pm
 
The basics of the oral presentation task is summarized in what I just wrote to the students:
Big Questions students,
I have had questions about the final oral presentations and final writing assignment.  Both the oral presentation and the final writing assignment will be on the subject of the nature of science inquiry with applications on either climate change or GMOs.
ORAL PRESENTATION:  The oral presentations will be prepared and given all during your workshop.  You will be giving the details of your task so you can prepare your presentations in next week’s workshop (Week 11) and then you will give the short presentation the following week (Week 12) at the end of the workshop.  You will be working in your small groups/ rooms.  The actual presentation will only be a 5-10 minutes.  It will be only in your small group (with a demonstrator present), where each of you needs to prepare 1-2 powerpoint slides and talk for about 1-2 min each.  The goal is to complete this task all during the workshops and not require too much outside of class preparation.  The Masters students will have a little different task of acting as a “Demonstrator” in your group, by helping you prepare your presentation, and then “marking” your presentation.  (However your real mark for the assessment will come from the real demonstrator in your group and myself!).  I had included a brief description in the course guide (below), which you probably haven’t looked at for awhile!
“Details of Task: Interactive mini seminar/conference in small groups followed by discussion period. Undergraduate students will prepare a 5-10-min powerpoint presentation on a big question in biology in small groups and present it to their table with a question and answer period at the end. This activity will concentrate on a big question in biology, where students will incorporate the synthesis of course discussions into a final presentation.  **BIOL6201Post-graduate students will be assessed differently than undergraduates for this assignment: will act as ""demonstrators/ teaching assistants"" by facilitating the organization of the presentation and critically evaluating / marking the presentation given by undergraduate students.”
Final Reflection Writing Piece :  Your “final exam” is another writing assignment that is aimed to be a more detailed “Critical Thinking Piece”.  The question will be built on the same question of your Oral Presentation. You will get all of this information (the details of the question) in next week’s workshop (Week 11).  You can use the information that you have gathered for your oral presentation in your group and apply it to your individual Final Reflection piece.  This final paper “exam” will be due the second week of finals, Wed June 17. Here is the general info about the task that is written in your course guide:
“Details of Task:  A reflective writing piece (1000 word limit) integrating the nature of science with applications to global health issues (climate change or GMOs) raised in the course. This piece will include supporting your ideas and arguments with examples that provide relevant support (citations required, at least 5).”
I will give you all more details about this next week.  In the meantime, I’ve included the documents that we used last year.  Your task is to be present in individual “rooms” with a group of about 7 students (~5 undergrads and 1-2 Masters students).  You will mostly be observing/ marking them.  One of the goals of this exercise is to give the Masters students the opportunity to play the role of the “demonstrator”….however, sometimes they need a little help from you, etc.  You will be evaluating how the Masters students do (Masters assessment attached) and then also mark the final presentations that are given by the undergrads (rubric attached).  It sounds confusing…but it worked out so well last year!
 
I have included the guidelines and marking sheets that we used last year.  However, I need to revise these as I try to work out all of the differences in the online forum vs. in class!  As you notice, last year we did this all in ONE workshop, where this year, we will do the same thing across TWO workshops (PREPARE in workshop 1, then PRESENT in workshop 2).  In the second workshop (4/5 June), they will have the first hour to get their finishing touches/ organize their presentations, and then use the second hour to deliver the presentation and have a discussion afterwards.  
If you have more ideas for improvement/ assessments/ ideas on these documents, please send me a note.  This was all a new assessment that I trialed out last year, so I welcome all ideas/improvements about it!  Keep track of any time you spend on feedback you give me, as you should get paid for this time as well.
I will be working on this more at the beginning of next week and send you the final version by Tues/Wed.
 
Phew!  I hope you are all well and I appreciate all of your help.
 
Cheers
Rachael

"Talk and my work in this area.","Hi Richard, Bernd and Arthur,
 
Bernds talk sparked a few areas that I have also found limited resources on. I have been working on using tidy data philosophy. I have come to this collection of packages in R:
 
 
 
I have been working on how to incorporate the general concept of computational reproducibility and have been drafting up ideas on where and why this concept should be published. Here is where I am at (an update for you Richard).
 
I have looked at the issues of database and came up with this solution https://github.com/ropenscilabs/dataspice
 

 
I can have a go at giving the demo talk attached and have incorporated from Bernds talk and Richards talk a few weeks ago. (powerpoint attached)
 
I would be interested in including the points and information that others have highlighted over the past weeks. I think that this would add value to many of the key Ecology journals.

"RE: Asana/Trello Boards","Hi all, 
 
I agree that it is quick confusing at the moment and I am definitely not sure if I am missing things or not. I am happy to work with any project management tools. Teams does it all but I don’t get it either and I have been using the `github` issues and projects component that also does this but still haven’t done this yet (below). 
 
Tello seems the best fit from my prospective but almost all cloud based storage company’s also have some form of these task boards.
 
I use something called IFTTT which writes simple scripts between communication tools. This is a way to connect the different information between different tools automatically.

Hi Josephine, 
 
I appreciate you taking initiative and looking into this for us. I have heard really good things about Trello and think it could be a really great tool for the UCSRC. I also think Trello will be a great way to keep us all accountable and on track ?? 
 
I agree that teams can be really tricky and ideas/communication can get inadvertently lost. 
 
Thank you for suggesting this!

Subject: Asana/Trello Boards
 
Hey, 
 
I know that emails and teams can be a bit confusing and it can be tricky to find out what everyone is working on/what people are up to so I had the idea to have a UCSRC asana or Trello board. 
 
We use Asana at my work and it is vital to my teams workflow. 
 
If you don't know what I am talking about, these companies both do online boards that track projects that people might be working on. You can make specific boards for projects or teams and then add cards to them. 
 
For example: 
 
We could make a UC Social Media Team board and then make three cards: 
1. Backlog(Tasks not yet started yet), 
2. doing and 
3. done. 
 
This way we can keep on task and know what everyone is doing. You can make these about as specific as you want. 
 
I have attached a screenshot of the Trello board that I use for the UC Design Society. It is a great tool to keep organized as a team. 
 
I am happy to set this up as it is easy and I have done it before (just make an account, set up the mainboards and then people can set up their own ones specific to them) 
 
Let me know what you think, 
 
Trello and Asana are quite similar and both useful. Asana does offer more features though. They are both free but have limits and constraints. Could be handy to try it out then upgrade if we feel it is necessary? 
 
Here are some links:

Hi Anthony,
 
Thank you kindly for your response. It looks like this could be a great opportunity for us all to work together to progress the PhD. It was my sincere aim to do this myself, but considering my personal circumstances this approach fits best at this time.
 
Ben and I would be very grateful to catch up. Zoom would be preferred for the initial discussion (I am immuno-compromised) and we can go from there :)
I am unfortunately only available on Wednesdays. Would this suit you all?

	Dear Ben and Dani,
	 
	Thank you for the opportunity. I am interested in this project but thought that I should explain where this sits for me quickly.
	 
	I have been doing a lot of plotting and reproducing different documents which I image will be very helpful for this sort of work. I have much of the code for mixed models in R using lme4 and other packages when I was comparing these results with my Bayesian Hierarchical models. 
	 
	I have also worked at UC on the same kind of situation with Dorjee (and to a lesser degree in the stats network many times) where over almost a year and $6000 I did the statistical model fitting and plotting for his PhD (Dr. now ??). I did very much underestimate the time and cost of this project even with the additional funding after my first quote of $4000. 
	 
	I am not sure what Andrew or Kyle sit with needing work but I am happy to let someone take the lead if it’s a better option for the project or they need the work more. Currently for me, this could be a good option to help financially support the final stages of my PhD and could mean that I would be less dependence on getting the 6 month IAE scholarship I have not finished getting ready (waiting on Uni paperwork).
	 
	Here are a few short notes on the project from my prospective and some key questions I have before I would have any idea how long it would take to complete.
	 
	I am not exactly sure how long it would take, but if it looks like it would work for each of us, then we can work this out.
	I am flexible with timelines but sooner the better as will be here teaching and on council till at least 2021.
	 
	Some background, Dani Cortez/Williams has been doing a PhD with Ross T and I. Unfortunately, Dani has had a series of health issues, which has slowed her down and she is also now working for the Federal Government giving her limited spare time. She now has quite an extensive dataset. We also have a small amount of unspent funds from an external funder. Given Dani’s on going health issues and limited time, we felt that these funds could be usefully spent employing someone to do the stats and make graphs, tables, etc. 
	I have helped out with data collection when Jon and her were working together (I don’t think it was on this project though).
	 
	We will give you the details, if you are (potentially) interested. But briefly, the data was collected to look at the response of stream macroinvertebrate in unregulated rivers (i.e. no dams) but which have various degree of water extracted from them. 
	What does the spatial distribution of the data look like? What does the temporal variation in the mean estimates look like?
	 
	Dani’s data are stream macroinvertebrate community data i.e. multispecies data. 
	To what level are the species categorised? Species/Genus etc??
	 
	These data were collected at collected at different sites and on different dates i.e. there is a species by sample matrix. 
	I have a similar situation with the invasive species data I look at for my PhD however there are far few species so the interactions are less complex. I think Andrew has much for background in this if I remember rightly.
	 
	She has collected the macroinvertebrates using two methods. The first giving present/absence of each species from one sample over a relative large section of the reach sampled on each sampling date. The second giving density data (#/m2) over three replicate relatively smaller areas from each reach sampled (on each sampling date). Dani also has some water quality and a lot of habitat/hydrological data both collected at the reach scale and exactly where the samples which provide density data were collected. 
	I also really like the concepts of comparing different datasets with different observation methods. This would fit in well with the more complex Bayesian Framework we could fit if the more traditional mixed models have issues with missing data.
	 
	We are wanting to do both multivariate analysis and analysis of univariate summary stats (e.g. species richness). Quite some thought went into the sampling design and there are specific hypothesizes we wish to test (although I it is not perfect given the difficulties of field research). 
	I think that this is well within my skill set and we may be able to extend this future by taking advantage of the additional benefits of fitting Bayesian models if the project ends up that far down the track.
	 
	I could go on (and Dani could go on for much longer than I can) but I think this should give you some information about these data to work out if analyses these is something that interests you.
	Thank you very much for the opportunity. Happy to discuss this further with Dani and yourself. Council sits tomorrow but anytime next week is ok for me.

	Anthony

	Hi Anthony, Andrew and Kyle, I am emailing you both to ask if either of you are interested in doing some statistical analysis, making graphs, tables, …., and being paid for it and also be included as a co-author in the resulting paper (when it is written up)? This is probably something for one of you to do.

"RE: Updates!!","Hi all, 
 
I have added my comments in Red Hamish. 
 
Regards,
Anthony
 
Been a while since I’ve done an update like this. Things are starting to kick off for Semester 2, and there are a few things we will be focussing on here, again I’ve highlighted important things in yellow. Please get back to me with things that are relevant to you!
 
1.	Town Hall 
So, early tomorrow the paperwork for the town hall will be ready to review for everyone, apologies for the length of time it took to get there, but I have been thinking about how it will work a lot and I believe I’ve found something that will fill the needs of the town hall without being too much work for us. 
 
Part one of the town hall, which will start this week, will involve us engaging online with students through our Canvas site on topics we gather from POPin. Here is where you come in. If you want to be part of the dedicated team that will be in charge of this, let me know and I will set up our Teams and we can begin work. We will still need to be brainstorming how we can address key questions that have to be answered prior to the commencement of semester 2, at the moment my idea is to have short infographic videos, or short talking head videos from the relevant staff, but it depends on availability. 
 
2.	Faculty Board reps 
If you sit on your faculty’s board, please get back to me! After Lola and her hardworking team of advocates sent in their Semester 1 figures, we saw some interesting patterns – most notably and over representation of students from Health seeking advocacy, an under representation from the Education and SciTech faculty’s, and no representation in FAD. I discussed these numbers with Geoff Crisp, and he said it would a good idea for each of the Faculty Board reps to get in touch with their Associate Dean of Education, and compare our advocacy numbers (i.e., number of students from the faculty that sought help from advocacy) to their grievance and misconduct numbers (i.e. number of students involved in processes that are relevant to advocacy), and then come up with a short report and some recommendations for how to engage with students who need advocacy, and report it back to the Faculty Board. If you sit on your faculty board, get back to me! 
 
3.	Survey !!
Lets finalise and get that feedback form out ASAP, then I want the survey team, once they have the results, to get a short report together and attend one of my regular catch ups with Geoff Crisp, and we can discuss what we can work on together moving forward.

Subject: Demonstrating for BIOL8291 (Research Presentation Skills) this semester?
 
Hi everyone,
 
I hope you are well.  With all the budget cuts and low enrollments, I'm not sure how many hours I can offer, but I was curious if you were interested in working a few hours next semester for this Masters course BIOL8291.  The administration already told us that I can't have demonstrators for the other Masters course, but I can have a few for this one.  Could you please let me know if you are interested and I can at least add your name on my budget.  I've attached our tentative timetable here, and would only need you for a few peer-review workshops, JC presentation and poster presentation as well as some marking (Assignment 1, Research Proposal Methods and News & Views).
 
Thank you!
Rachael

Sorry Dani, I didn’t mean to bother you this morning. This is very helpful thankyou Ben. I have plenty to incorporate into the analysis to get a feel for the key questions being addressed and how the data matches/aligns with this next week along with final plans for the overall steps in the project.

Thanks Anthony, you will see that I have sent you the macroinvertebrate data (and some notes about these data). I have also sent an invite to meet via zoom next week. If you (Anthony) can try to progress your plans and ‘paperwork’ by next Wed that would be great. 
 
Please note that, I am on leave tomorrow and Friday this week.

"RE: HOW ARE YOU GOING","Hi Richard,
 
Sorry for the long silence. I have been working on providing examples to tidypipes and have a publication in review with Nature as a comment (see attached). 
 
And I have attached the tidyPipes examples and references that will hopefully make it a clearer. 
 
I have thought about where to publish this and have also extended out the Nature comment to a possible publication in PeerJ following a similar publication in 2018 titled: …
 
As for the PhD examples I have constructed my timelines in a tidyPipes workflow and also the invasive species database (still working on this).
 
When would suit for a meeting? Would like to hear your opinion on this? Totally understand if it still doesn’t  match any opportunities in ecology currently.
 
Regards,
Anthony

Hi Anthony
 
Do you want to catch-up? As far as I know, if you haven’t applied for a six month extension from the IAE, you should be eligible for that.
And be good to hear how things are going. Let me know when might suit.
 
Cheers
Richard

Subject: RE: HOW ARE YOU GOING
 
Hi Barbara,
 
All very crazy with the world. I’m not too sure what to do really. I having been making it work but it’s all very uncertain without a scholarship at the moment. I think it had got all too much a few weeks ago but have been trying to just keep plodding along. 
 
I have now got what I think is a good plan and outline for the next 6months but there are a few options/ideas I am not sure are available even. I think my options are:
 
1.	IAE extension scholarship (I think this is not possible now?)
2.	Covid19 extension (not possible anymore I don’t think)
3.	Working with Ben on some more statistics. This looks promising but can I do this as any of the following?
	a.	Scholarship
	b.	Casual research assistant (extension of casual contract or new one?)
	c.	ABN number invoiced
 
Can you give me a call when you get a moment so I can explain this a bit better and work out what is possible? 

Regards,
Anthony

Subject: HOW ARE YOU GOING
 
Dear Anthony,
 
Saw some sick leave certificates come in last week and meant to send an email then to see that you were going OK?
 
COVID-19 has certainly thrown up some tough and challenging times and no-one is immune from the effects albeit in different ways.  Have you returned to campus or WFH is still your best option?
 
I will be continuing to WFH for a while to come.  Its not that I don’t want to return but my husband has significant health (heart and now lung) issues so limiting contact with the outside world is my/his preferred option.  We are lucky to live with a bit of space and I now have daily walks up and down the vineyard which is very pleasant.  Obviously we haven’t had physical contact with the grandkids for sometime but they understand that COVID-19 could seriously impact on Grumps and the other grandmother’s health so zooming is the way.  They seem to be coping and going back to school has helped as being back with their mates is ‘the best fun’!
 
Anyway if there is anything I can do to assist you, please do not hesitate to be in contact.
 
Kind Regards
 
Barbara

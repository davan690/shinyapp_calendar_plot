Incorporating evolutionary processes into conservation in a changing world





Paul Sunnucks
Persistence and Research Team, School of Biological Sciences, Monash University

Although fitness of individuals is evolutionary in nature, and adaptation to changing environments can occur very rapidly, until recently, evolutionary genetic variation has been under the radar in conservation planning. Only a few percent of threatened species plans contain actions aimed to manage genetic diversity, despite genetic diversity being recognized by the IUCN as one of three levels of biodiversity.  However, this picture is changing fast, owing to new thinking and ever-accelerating ability to obtain useful genetic data quickly and cost-effectively. The talk will explore why and how decisions can be made about genetic management of wildlife species, with examples encompassing two ongoing research programs on genetic rescue of threatened species, and a study of a little bird that is full of big surprises.

About Paul

By happy accident, Paul’s training led him to the intersection between conservation biology and evolutionary genetics.  A Zoology degree at Oxford University was followed by a PhD at University College London applying genetic markers to understanding animal population biology. This prepared him for joining one of the first conservation genetics groups in the world, at the Institute of Zoology, London, applying genetics for conservation of endangered species.  Since that exciting time, his career has been spent in Australia with many national and international collaborators, applying genetic and evolutionary thinking to conservation of threatened species.  He works closely with wildlife management agencies and other biodiversity stakeholders, participating in threatened species policy and planning.  He has an inordinate fondness for all lifeforms, and with >20 PhD graduates has enjoyed working with ~ 100 species.  Having promised himself to never write a book, his first was Frankham et al. (2017) Genetic Management of Fragmented Animal and Plant Populations, the second was Frankham et al. (2019) A Practical Guide for Genetic Management of Fragmented Animal and Plant Populations, and he is about to start on a third.

Seminar 1: Bio-Mimetic Technologies for Deformable Object Manipulation




Fast fashion has become one of the largest industries on the planet, worth three trillion dollars annually while making up two percent of the worlds GDP. In Australia alone, six tons of clothing waste is sent to landfill every ten minutes. Recycling processes based around fabric have recently been introduced to prevent a significant amount of clothing being sent to landfill. However, these processes are limited by the required labor involved in preparing the waste for recycling. This work is centered around building technology to autonomously sort and prepare to clothe for these processes.

In robotics, fabric manipulation is a difficult and multi-faceted task that has many challenges. One specific challenge is the mechanics of grasping fabric. In the past, devices have been built specifically designed to grasp and manipulate fabric for a variety of domestic purposes. Early works in this area have noted how fabric manipulation is a series of actions that are primarily performed by humans, thus any attempts to design devices for this task should consider bioinspired features. By observing fabric manipulation from a human-centric perspective, we can significantly improve the mechanics and functionality of end-effectors designed to manipulate deformable objects.

David Hinwood is PhD candidate from the University of Canberra. He graduated from the University on Canberra with a degree in Software Engineering in 2015. After spending a year in the IT workforce he returned to complete an honours thesis in robotics centred around the Robocop soccer tournament. Once complete an interest in robotics led him to pursue a PhD on the topic of fashion recycling. Research interests include robotics, human-centred technology and design. 





	





Seminar 2: “On Propensity Score Methodology”




Propensity score methodology is a group of methods used in observational non-randomized studies to estimate the causal effects of treatment between two groups, a treatment and a non-treatment group.

Propensity score methods are particularly popular in the fields of medical, pharmaceutical and social sciences. Propensity score methodology can be suited to determine effects caused by, not only treatment of pharmaceutical medication, but for “treatment” of some external event, proposed event or interaction within the wider community.

However, there are mixed views for the best methodologies to use and an overall understanding of the propensity score methodology. The literature that surround propensity score methods can at times be confusing as propensity score terminology and process are not clearly defined, which can lead to a misunderstanding of the methodology.

The main objective of the presentation is to demonstrate how propensity score methodology can be used to answer questions on effects caused by an external event or interaction on a community. Also, that propensity score methodology needs to be given a framework that can be followed, explained and reported that will help allow for robust decision making, planning and policy decisions to be undertaken.

Seminar 1: Preventing Railway Suicide through Human Behaviour Analysis from Surveillance Videos


The goal of computer vision is to let computers understand a scene through the eyes of a camera. In recent years, the number of surveillance cameras installed to monitor private and public places has increased dramatically. One of the most difficult challenges in the domain of computer vision and artificial intelligence is understanding the behaviour of people from observing their activities in a surveillance video.

In some circumstances, it is necessary to analyze the behaviour of people and determine whether their behaviour is normal or abnormal. This research project aims to develop a detection framework for unusual human behaviour and apply this framework to the problem of railway suicide. One type of suicide that has increased in recent years is railway suicide. Many people die each year by intentional self-harm in and around train stations in Australia. In the Sydney metropolitan area, this equates to more than a death a week. This rate has more than doubled in recent years. So, suicide prevention is a major concern for railway operators internationally. In response, this study investigates a contribution toward an automated suicide risk detection system and try to develop a real-time early warning system to provide Sydney Trains with the ability to respond quickly to at-risk individuals. This PhD project is part of an ARC linkage project, which is being run in partnership with Sydney Trains and the national TrackSafe Foundation which was set up by the rail industry to reduce rail related injuries and fatalities.

Seminar 2: EEG lossy compression and its impact on EEG-based pattern recognition


Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely studied in EEG-based pattern recognition (EBPR) systems such as epileptic seizure, sleep stage, emotion, alcoholics and person recognitions. Storing and transmitting EEG data, which is massive in size, are significant challenges for compression algorithms. Lossy compression is preferred as it has a higher compression ratio than lossless compression. However, lossy compression may negatively influence the performance of EBPR systems due to the loss of information in the reconstructed data. This thesis focuses on developing effective lossy compression algorithms for both general and epileptic EEG data and investigating the impact of lossy compression on EBPR systems.

Dr Katie Moon, UNSW Canberra

Ecologists have long been concerned about the declining health of ecological systems. Increasingly, ecologists are looking to social scientists to help understand and solve one of the greatest threats to ecosystems: people. Social scientists study the social system and, often, it’s relationship with the ecological system. The ways in which they do so can differ in fundamental ways to the study of ecological systems. This presentation provides a window in the world of social science, explaining how knowledge is created or discovered and pointing to opportunities for improved social-ecological outcomes.

Population Genetic Structure and Breeding Activity of Two Native Fish (Golden Perch and Murray Cod) From a Managed Catchment: A Case Study from Lachlan River





Mr Foyez Shams, PhD Student, Institute for Applied Ecology 

Golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) are two large-bodied freshwater fish species native to Australia with significant indigenous, cultural, recreational and commercial value. Both species have widely been breeding in commercial hatcheries and stocked in different river systems of Murray Darling Basin (MDB). Lachlan, one of the largest rivers of MDB with long term isolation from the other catchments, dynamic hydrologic regime, habitat fragmentation and a long history of native fish stocking. Despite initial aim of stocking to enhance the recreational fisheries of this popular sport fishes in the Lachlan river, stocking is being considered one of the conservation efforts lately. It is yet unknown if the catchment is being maintained by either stocked or wild fish or both stocked and wild born fish coexist through natural spawning in the river. The absence of M. ambigua larvae, evident from long term intervention monitoring project also boost the urgency of filling the knowledge gap. Aim of the present study is to investigate population genetic structure and breeding activity of golden perch and Murray cod from the Lachlan river using genetic and otolith microchemistry analysis. Outcome of the study suggests the presence of breeding activity of golden perch using otolith microchemistry analysis and null to moderate genetic structuring of golden perch and Murray cod in the Lachlan river. As a comparative tool to identify hatchery breed stocked and wild born golden perch from the Lachlan river, analysis of otolith microchemistry has been proved effective over genetic (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and Silico/Present Absent markers) data. We also identified their mode of sex determination along with first report of karyotype.

Breaking the positive feedback cycle that reinforces lake degradation in an era of global change





David Hamilton
Deputy Director, Australian Rivers Institute,
Griffith University, Brisbane

Lakes are sentinels for global change. Pressures from climate change, land use change and introductions of invasive species are amplified within lake basins. I use examples of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) blooms, surface water temperature and dissolved oxygen in bottom waters as health indicators to show the non-linear responses of lakes to these multiple pressures. Many of the pressures are amplified by self-reinforcing feedback loops related to water temperature, stratification, light attenuation and surface accumulations of cyanobacteria. Restoring lakes needs to address these feedback loops and provide a more coordinated, interdisciplinary approach to build resilience to global change pressures.

Effects of climate change on Australian alpine plant-pollinator networks





Francisco Encinas-Viso
Centre of Australian National Biodiversity Research, CSIRO

Alpine ecosystems around the world are threatened due to climate change. The presence of pollinators is critical for the reproduction of many alpine plant species, however the shrinking of alpine ecosystems and changes in species phenologies might drive a rapid decline of plant-pollinators interactions that we are unaware. In this talk, I will present results of our research investigating the effects of climate change in alpine plant-pollinator communities as well as our current challenges. We have analysed changes of a plant-pollinator community in the Australian Alps using as a baseline plant-pollinator community data collected 30 years ago and comparing it to recent data. We have also used both traditional methods (flower-visitor observations) and novel approaches (pollen DNA metabarcoding) to quantify plant-pollinator network structure. Overall we found evidence suggesting that climate change is altering alpine plant-pollinator community composition and structure, and the shrinking of Australian alpine ecosystems.

Drains, ponds and a green lake: A summary of findings from the urban stormwater project





Rod Ubrihien, Research Fellow, Institute for Applied Ecology 

Managing stormwater and associated pollutants is a major problem in urban catchments. The urban stormwater project consisted of two studies which will be discussed in this seminar:


*	Lake Tuggeranong research project
	

Lake Tuggeranong has had persistent problems with blue-green algal blooms leading to lake closure. Blue-green algae blooms are potentially toxic, produce odour and are unsightly. As such they reduce the aesthetic, recreational and environmental benefits derived from Lake Tuggeranong. An investigation into the factors leading to cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Tuggeranong and in-lake trials to investigate possible management solutions will be discussed.


*	Urban ponds
	

Urban ponds are a key feature of Canberra’s urban stormwater network. Urban ponds are used as a water sensitive urban design feature to remove contaminants from urban stormwater.  An investigation of the effectiveness of Canberra’s urban ponds and the effect of altering water regime on nutrient attenuation was undertaken.

Options for evaluating biodiversity conservation and their relative strengths of inference





Emeritus Professor Jim Hone, Institute for Applied Ecology 

Management of wildlife species to conserve them needs to evaluate whether the conservation aim(s) has been achieved. Managers and researchers can be very confident (stronger inference) to uncertain (weaker inference) about whether an aim has been achieved and whether that was caused by management. There are three broad options for evaluations; first, those showing trajectories over time; second, those showing responses to management efforts; and third, those showing trajectories over time in response to management.  All approaches should use analysis of response to evaluate management effects, and evaluate predictions of trends and effects of management efforts, in order to strengthen causal inferences. We illustrate the options with examples from wild populations around the world.

Scrambled and fried: multigenerational oocyte dysfunction and reproductive toxicants





Prof Eileen McLaughlin, Executive Dean, Faculty of Science and Technology 

Following the proposition in 1989 that many long term chronic adult diseases originated in the fetus, studies have concluded that a wide range of diseases from obesity to asthma have been found to have been instigated in early development. As both mammalian oocyte and male germ cell development begins in fetal life, it has been suggested that environmental and lifestyle factors of the mother could directly impact the fertility of subsequent generations. Cigarette smoke is a known toxicant, yet disturbingly a significant proportion of women continue to smoke throughout pregnancy. The focus of our investigations has been to characterize, using an animal model, the adverse effects of smoking directly on ovary and oocyte quality in female offspring and testes and sperm development of male mice exposed in utero and on subsequent generations. In summary, our results demonstrate that pregnancy and lactational exposure to cigarette smoke can have long-lasting profound and subtle effects on the fertility of the next generation(s) of female and male offspring.

Seven Types of Ambiguity: Resolving confusing conversations in conservation





Adjunct Professor Peter Bridgewater, Institute for Applied Ecology, University of Canberra  

Nature needs half; a new deal for nature; natural capital; transformative change; ecosystem services; natures contributions to people: just some of the confusing ecobabble facing politicians in the lead-in to the Convention on Biological Diversity CoP in 2020. But rather than scramble for new things, we already have the tools to craft better ways to deal with biodiversity, we are just not using them well or effectively. Focusing on Natura 2000, urban ecological infrastructure, the Australian Landcare program, UNESCO Biosphere Reserves and community conserved areas, and drawing on the positive messages in the IPBES Global Assessment, I argue that an integrated approach with existing tools can reach a global biodiversity balance by 2030 – without invoking confusing or unreachable targets.

Please join us for this week SAGE. Sarah Whitley will give her confirmation seminar with the detail below:

Title: Epigenetic regulation of thermosensitive sexual development in two Australian Dragon Lizards

Summary: The sexual development of many reptile species is determined by the temperatures to which the eggs are exposed during embryonic development. This phenomena, known as temperature dependent sex determination, was discovered over 50 years ago, and yet the mechanism by which this temperature cue is transduced to a sexual outcome has remained unidentified. Using two emerging model species (Pogona vitticeps and Amphibolurus muricatus) with thermosensitive sexual development, experiments will be conducted to demonstrate the mechanisms by which a temperature signal determines sex.

Title: Guardians of the Galaxias: Understanding the ecology of a threatened galaxiid and a novel approach to conservation management

Abstract: Small-bodied freshwater fishes around the world are imperilled. Habitat modification and introduced fishes are often reputed as the main causes of decline, with introduced species significant in the decline of many small-bodied species. Many threatened freshwater fishes are restricted to refugia habitats where in-stream barriers prevent upstream advance of introduced species. In-stream protection may include natural (e.g. waterfall) or artificial (e.g. road culverts, dams, weirs) barriers. 

Many species are restricted to small, isolated headwaters and may have only few or single populations. Small relictual populations are at increased risk of damage or complete loss from stochastic climate events such as bushfire, drought or localised catchment events, while risk of stream desiccation increases with climate change and a drying climate. Where only a small number of populations remain, risk of losing entire species to such events is exacerbated. 

Establishment of additional populations through translocation is essential to ensure continuation of species and genetic diversity. Additional populations may be founded by wild fish from existing populations or from hatchery-bred fish. Captive populations also provide additional insurance against loss of fish in the wild. To effectively raise fish in captivity reproductive ecology must be well-understood and programs must consider environmental cues and physical requirements of spawning. Details of early life-history including age to maturity, longevity and fecundity are fundamental in developing and executing effective captive breeding efforts. 

Translocation sites must meet fundamental requirements for long-term sustainability of a new population, having suitable spawning habitat and environmental conditions, be of sufficient spatial extent to allow individuals to express normal behaviour and movement patterns and importantly provide a barrier to introduced fishes. Spatial requirements of fishes are traditionally investigated using acoustic- and radio-telemetry technologies. These types of monitoring are limited to larger species where large tag and battery size does not affect regular activities of tagged individuals. Recent advances in telemetry technology mean smaller fish may be monitored in spatial use studies, formerly restricted to larger species. 

Potential translocation sites are traditionally evaluated using widely-available satellite imagery, topographic maps and more recently, LIDAR data. These technologies can detect large-scale habitat features, stream and catchment structure and large barriers (e.g. dam walls), however their suitability declines in small headwater streams. With small streams often located in remote areas, researchers are required to travel on foot for preliminary assessment of potential translocation sites in these areas, a time-consuming and costly exercise. The implementation of new high-resolution mapping and analytical technologies in providing a time- and cost-effective method for preliminary evaluation of translocation sites will allow research effort to be directed on understanding requirements of threatened species. 

The project will investigate the application of new technologies and ecological understanding in the establishment of additional populations of threatened fishes.

Analysis of natural occurring arsenic containing ribosides by HPLC-ICPMS

Using a zirconium anion exchange chromatography and synthesis of chiral arsenoriboses standards. 

Mrs Eman Alkasasbeh, Institute for Applied Ecology, University of Canberra  

The metalloid arsenic is potentially a toxic element and is naturally found in the diet, particularly seafood, as well as drinking water. Arsenic-containing ribosides constitute an important class of natural arsenic species that are biosynthesized by marine macroalgae. Their importance emerges from being part of the transformation and cycling of arsenic species in the marine environment. Among the different approaches to understanding arsenoribose formation, biotransformation, characterization of their metabolites, toxicity and human exposure, is the quantification and identification of those species in the marine organisms. The growing awareness of the toxicity of arsenoriboses has led to the development of new analytical techniques for their analysis. This research project aims to (1) improve speciation methods for arsenoriboses current performed using a HPLC-ICPMS with a silica-based anion exchange column by using a zirconium-based anion exchange column (2) synthesize the chiral arsenoriboses as standards for analysis.

Thanks for your interest in forming a Faculty of Health led “Healthy HDR Club”. 

 

After encouragement from Jennie and Janie during the 2018 HDR Intensive, we have now received the green light to go ahead and form the club from UC Life and Inclusion. 

 

Some of the “event” suggestions that have been proposed and suggested include:

*	Our own research presentation event (w/Prize Money)
*	Breakfast Networking Event(s) – either just HDR students, w/invited guests, or both
*	Fundraising event for a local charity
*	Journal club
*	Social events (hiking, pub, etc.)
*	Presence at the UC FoH open day.

 

Committee members will be required for the club to receive funding ($3,000/year), and roles include (but are not limited to) President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer. Any role on the committee would be something that you can add to your CV. 

 

It would be great if as many people as possible can attend the inaugural meeting. As they say, many hands make light work. 

 

Please bring as many of your HDR friends as possible including Masters research students, and undergraduate or Honours students that are interested in postgraduate research. Please forward to anyone that may be interested! If you can’t attend, but want to be involved, please let me know. 

 

The room will be announced closer to the day. Also, be sure to bring some snacks or beverages, and any ideas you may have.

 

Cheers,

Nathan

Dr Lizzie Wandrag, Institute for Applied Ecology, University of Canberra 

Niche availability and the strength of interspecific competition for shared niche space determine the potential for plant species to co-occur and hence local species richness. However, methods to quantify niche availability and interspecific competition are difficult to implement and require detailed knowledge of the system being studied. I will: 1) describe a method to quantify niche availability and interspecific competition using seed addition experiments; 2) describe experiments carried out on UC campus that show how the method can allow questions about niche availability and competition to be empirically tested; and 3) highlight key insights into the factors that govern the distribution and local abundance of plant species.

D-Prof. Arthur Georges, Institute for Applied Ecology, University of Canberra 

Professor Arthur Georges is a member of the Institute for Applied Ecology at the University of Canberra, and its foundation director. Arthur leads a research team of fellow academics and research students investigating the mechanisms of sex determination in reptiles -- how environment interacts with genotype to determine sex.
Team Pogona is addressing both the genetic mechanisms of sex determination in species with conventional sex chromosomes and the mechanisms by which environment can supplant or subvert the genetic determination of sex. Currently, this ARC-funded team is exploring differential gene expression in normal dragon lizards and those sex-reversed by temperature to identify candidate targets for thermal influence. The ultimate aim is to better understand how the thermal signal is transduced to influence the epigenetic and genetic mechanisms of sex determination.

This seminar will present an overview of where the research is at, and where it is heading.

Geological structures, meddling in the flow of unwary groundwater 

Tony Bernardi, UC
Geological structures can change the way that groundwater moves in the landscape in surprising ways. In this study, we are looking at untangling the complexity of groundwater movement in a weathered granite upland catchment cross-cut by resistant aplite dyke complex.  Equipotential lines of the fractured rock groundwater system indicate that the flow is complex. Initially, the groundwater flows in a northerly direction down the slope in the upper part of the catchment towards its outlet.  Flow direction begins to veer to the NNW upslope of a major salt scald and then flows to the NW in the middle of the scald.  We propose that the salt scald is caused by groundwater being interrupted in its flow north towards Little River by a sub-surface geological formation acting as a dam wall. The groundwater flow is slowed and rises closer to the surface in the scalded area as it found an alternative route down the slope.

About Tony
Tony has spent the past 18 years conducting field-based research in accessing the impacts of changing landuse and management on salinity, water and productivity in agricultural landscapes, in a range of large multi-disciplinary hydrology projects, These included the Deep Drainage Project on the Liverpool Plains, the NSW Salinity Strategy Statewide Recharge Validation Project and the NAP NSW State Level Activity Key Sites Project. Tony’s particular research interests are the effect of landuse on the export of salt and water from small upland catchments and the connectivity of stream and the alluvial and groundwater systems. Currently, Tony is valiantly attempting to complete his PhD.

This work includes: field and laboratory based physico-chemical, hydrogeochemistry and stable isotope analysis of rainwater, snow, surface water and groundwater to better understand how hydrologic systems function in this region. There are a range of applications for this work but foremost are: evaluation of the potable water resource in the Upper Murrumbidgee, understanding the influence of rainfall patterns and the influence on agriculture, exploration of the hydrogeologic controls on tree dieback in the Monaro, evaluation of the water budget in the  alpine humus soils / alpine bogs and fens systems as pertains to climate change and faunal impact, and the analysis of the water quality in alpine and tableland streams. At UC, H2O Connect runs the technical aspects of monitoring a hydro-array (telemetered weather stations, piezometer and borehole arrays) that operates at several sites in inland NSW (from Wagga Wagga to central West NSW) and at Mulloon Creek. There is overlap and complementarity in the work of the ANU team and the work of UC IAE water researchers, and this forum provides a mechanism for these synergies to be discussed further.

 

 

Profile

Dr Leah Moore has worked on a range of land and water management research projects,

many in collaboration with NSW and other state government agencies and Catchment

Management Authorities/Local Land Services. Her research focuses on biophysical

characterisation of landscapes in order to understand: how water moves through and over

rock and regolith (including soil) materials; the influence of other parameters (e.g.

vegetation, infrastructure) on land and water processes; the impacts of changes in climate

and land management on these processes; and, how this knowledge can inform the

development of strategic management strategies in target catchments. Leah’s current

projects include: hydrogeological landscape (HGL) characterisation in south east NSW and

northern Tasmania with dryland salinity hazard management and geotechnical evaluation

applications; hydrogeological controls on NSW Southern Tableland wetland associations

(surface water/groundwater connectivity); Central Murrumbidgee (Jugiong/ Muttama/

Tarcutta) target catchment overview of abiotic ecological parameters to inform the NSW

Salinity Strategy; and collaboration with MDB Futures CRN staff on a project using

hydrogeological and groundwater information to model invertebrate responses to drought

in the Upper Murrumbidgee Catchment and in Victoria. Integrating the HGL

contextualisation of surface water modelling and associated ecological modelling informs

linked HGL, hydrology and ecology research, particularly studies of surface water and

Dr Dan Rosauer, ANU

The first part of this talk will cover recent approaches to mapping evolutionary diversity, as used in a major study of lizard diversity in Australia’s monsoonal tropics to identify conservation priorities in collaboration with land managers. A phylogenetic approach to mapping biodiversity allows us to seamlessly integrate variation within and between species, sidestepping issues of uncertain taxonomy. I will then present an exciting project in its early stages, using a dynamic spatial model of evolutionary processes at phylogeographic scale to understand how species, landscapes and climate interact over time to generate diversity.

The Clarence River catchment is the largest river system on the southeast coast of Australia. The most striking and intriguing feature of this catchment is the dramatic change in drainage direction along its western margin, where NE-trending streams intersect the south-flowing Clarence River. Two models involving drainage reversal or drainage diversion have been proposed to explain the development of the present Clarence River (Haworth and Ollie, 1992; McQueen, 2016). Both models imply that the western and southern drainage pattern is inherited from a much older, northerly drainage initiated in the Jurassic during development of the Clarence-Moreton Basin and prior to continental rifting and formation of the Tasman Sea. The present southerly drainage developed after infilling and deformation of the Clarence-Moreton Basin and following major Cenozoic volcanism. This period of catchment evolution was marked by significant drainage diversion and disruption.  Interestingly, the local indigenous Bunjalung people have an explanation for the origin of the Clarence River (Breimba), which involves a series of incisions, disruptions and diversions of the river by Dirrangun, a dreamtime ‘witch’. Specific sites in this story include those identified as key geomorphic sites for determining the development of the drainage. It is clear the story of Dirrangun is based on observation and interpretation of landscape features involving an understanding of the basic concepts of erosion, incision and deposition, as well as stream diversion and disruption.

Topic

Reimagining the role of natural ecosystems in Australia’s medium-sized cities. We have an increasing understanding of the critical role that natural systems have in providing ecosystem services in urban and peri-urban landscapes. Those services range from carbon uptake and temperature moderation, to the aesthetic, psychological and recreational benefits of healthy natural ecosystems embedded in urban landscapes. Using the language of ‘green’ (terrestrial vegetation) and ‘blue’ (water related) infrastructure, I will provide a brief background on the evolution of perspectives of nature in cities. I will then discuss what a medium sized city may look like with reference to provision of ecosystem services.

Canberra’s own endangered grassland earless dragon? Recent trends and possible futures

Professor Stephen Sarre

Grassland Earless Dragons are a group of small lizards, specialised to natural grasslands. One species, which includes populations from the Canberra/Queanbeyan region, is currently identified as endemic to south-eastern Australia. Recent taxonomic revision splits this species into four which, if accepted, would mean that we have seen the first likely extinction of a reptile on the Australian mainland and a new species endemic to the ACT and Queanbeyan. Stephen will summarise three decades of research on earless dragons and include an analysis of recent population trends to speculate on the possible future for Canberra’s own (putative) grassland earless dragon.

Title: Parasite of trout, Salmo trutta fario (Linnaeus, 1758): Diversity of trout parasites in the streams flowing into lake Lucerne

 

Abstract:  A comparison of the metazoan parasite communities was carried out among eleven streams flowing into Lake Lucerne in Switzerland. Two main hypotheses were evaluated. First, parasitic communities are thought to be more diverse in groundwater-fed than surface water-fed streams, because the greater the richness of the invertebrate community in the stream, the easier it will be for the parasite with a complex life cycle to be transmitted. Second, parasite communities would be more diverse and more abundant in streams where migration rates of adult fish are high than in those where migration is low. Eleven species of metazoan parasites or taxa were collected from the brown trout studied, including three cestodes, three digenes, one monogen, three acanthocephala and one nematode. The source of water and host migration significantly explain the variation of parasite communities between streams. As expected, parasitic communities were more diverse in streams with a high adult migration rate, supporting our hypothesis that migratory adult fish could enrich parasite communities in streams. In addition, species richness of parasites was significantly higher in groundwater-fed streams. For the two taxa present in both types of watercourse; in Crepidostomum sp., abundance was positively correlated with the two main variables, the migration rate and the water source, whereas for Gyrodactylus sp., abundance was only influenced by the fish gender.

Title: Condition of mangroves (Avicennia marina) in Wagonga Inlet, Narooma

 

Abstract: Mangroves are an important group of plants that provide fish and crustaceans with nursery habitat, protect shorelines from storm damage and can store large volumes of carbon. Over the last two years, some of the mangrove (Avicennia marina) communities in Wagonga Inlet, Narooma have been observed to be undergoing dieback. This dieback event is characterised by localised patches of dead mangroves located close to the estuary’s main channel and mouth. An assessment of the vegetation condition of the mangroves in Wagonga Inlet, including an assessment of the extent of dieback in the inlet, and an investigation into the potential drivers of mangrove dieback were conducted by this study. The vegetation condition was good throughout the inlet, except for the areas of dieback. Mangrove dieback was restricted to the areas that were originally identified. Although no conclusive cause of dieback has been identified, sand content of the soil and nutrient concentrations in the soil were very low at the dieback sites, potentially as a result of increased sedimentation of sand at the sites.

Title:  Does climatic thermal variability matter for patterns and processes of biodiversity?

 

Reich, J. K. A

Speaker email: Jollene.Reich@canberra.edu.au <mailto:Jollene.Reich@canberra.edu.au> 

 



 

ABSTRACT: 

The ‘climate variability hypotheses’ (CVH) posed by Janzen (1967), postulates that temperature gradients across mountain ranges determine its effectiveness as a barrier, for dispersal/migration, rather than height. E.g. if the same temperature gradient was found on a flat plain, the ‘barrier’ would still exist preventing species dispersal (Janzen 1967). This hypothesis postulates that an organism exposed to greater (annual or seasonal) thermal variability has a broader thermal tolerance and therefore, a greater geographical distribution and vice versa (Janzen 1967). 

Populations separated by climatic variability are expected to have reduced gene flow leading to greater genetic divergence and allopatric speciation (Ghalambor et al. 2006). Despite fundamental ecological importance, there has been limited testing of key components of the CVH (Ghalambor et al. 2006). I aim to use freshwater macroinvertebrate communities along elevational gradients at different latitudes in Australia (temperate and tropical regions), along with comparative data from the Americas (Polato et al. 2018), to determine the predictive power of the CVH and its underlying mechanisms. The thermal regime at all sites will be measured over 2.5 years. I predict that tropical species which live in relatively thermally stable environments (compared to temperate species) will; (i) tolerate narrower temperature ranges and (ii) have reduced dispersal, because of temperature barriers, resulting in reduced gene flow between populations and therefore, greater genetic structuring. 

 

KEY WORDS: Climatic variability, freshwater macroinvertebrates, allopatric speciation, gene flow

Title: Determining the Trophic Foundations of a Salmonid Fishery. 

 

Abstract: Salmonid fisheries in the Snowy Mountains of Australia are an important recreational, social and economic asset. Despite this high value, inconsistent management stemming partly from a lack of understanding has seen recreational fishing success decline in recent years. To contribute to the body of knowledge that will facilitate improved management of this group of fish, the major energy pathways supporting salmonid fishes in Lake Jindabyne and its tributaries were studied. Stable isotope and gut content analysis techniques were employed to characterise the movement of energy towards salmonid fishes in littoral, pelagic and lotic habitats. Littoral margins of Lake Jindabyne were found to be an important foraging habitat for salmonid species of all sampled size classes. Tributaries were less reliant on terrestrial detritus than initially anticipated, placing some emphasis on in-situ primary production. Some connection between lentic and lotic habitats was established, however further fine-scale analysis is needed to strengthen this finding.

Abstract: Climate change research has mainly focused on changes in mean conditions, with little consideration given to temporal temperature variability. However, fluctuation in temperature has been shown to alter the physiological performance of species. During her PhD, Bea will test competing mechanistic explanations of physiological tolerance to understand the impact of climate change-induced thermal variability on aquatic macroinvertebrates in tropical and temperate mountains. The ‘Climate Variability Hypothesis’ by Janzen (1967) predicts tolerance range to vary with annual temperature range. Bea will incorporate diel temperature variability at different gradients to assess macroinvertebrate performance under differing temperature regimes. She will measure sub-lethal critical thermal maximum (CTMAX) and minimum (CTMIN) of sensitive macroinvertebrates and effects of constant varying temperatures on their performance by comparing differing preferred temperature variability ranges.

Abstract:

Over the past two years we have investigated Lake Tuggeranong and the surrounding catchments. The focus of this investigation has been to understand the factors that lead to blue-green algae in the lake and to provide advice on options to manage blue-green algae in Lake Tuggeranong. In this seminar I will provide a brief summary of the key results from the project and discuss some options for the next stage of the project.

Abstract: The germination macrophytes within constructed urban wetlands (CUW) is directly linked to water level regimes. CUW water level regimes have predictable wetting and drying sequences with little water level variation and therefore community response to the introduction of fluctuating water level regimes is unknown. Through the undertaking of a seedbank emergence study incorporating varying water regime treatments (watered, soaked, inundated), seedbank response was examined. The germinable seedbanks of 12 selected Canberra CUW were comprised mostly of amphibious perennial species, meaning that emergent plant species able to tolerate and have seed which can remain viable after inundation would be present after short term drawdown. Over a longer period of time this may change however with an increase in annual and terrestrial species, through regular CUW drawdown and less available water.

Title: Why are mayflies sensitive to salinity?

 

Abstract: The salinity is increasing in many freshwaters around the world because of a range of human activities - including agriculture, mining and road de-icing. Field, mesocosm and laboratory studies show that mayflies (Ephemeroptera) are particularly sensitive to small rises in salinity. In fact, evidence is emerging that many mayflies are adversely affected by salinity levels which cannot be explained by generally accepted theories of osmoregulation in aquatic animals. In this presentation, I will explore various conceptual hypotheses as to why mayflies are so salinity sensitive.  Key to these hypotheses are the observation of an increasing rate of sodium and sulphate uptake by mayflies studied as the external concentrations of these ions increases. These hypotheses have to do with the energy requirements of increased ion uptake, (localised) loss of internal pH regulation or (localised) ion toxicity. I advocate vigorous testing of these hypotheses to better understand the effects of increasing salinity on mayflies and thus better manage adverse effects of rising salinity levels in freshwater.

Abstract: The Earth continues to suffer high rates of species loss, with profound consequences for communities and ecosystem function (hereafter biodiversity loss), because of human impacts. Currently the most important causes of biodiversity loss are land use change, habitat fragmentation, pollution, modification to the hydrological cycle, introduced species and over harvesting. Overlaying these changes is the looming threat from global climate change. Climate change is predicted to alter temperature regimes including diel and seasonal variability and thermal extremes, and to change rainfall regimes include total, timing, intensity and predictability. Changes in climate will interact with other human-induced stressor, but the nature of those interactions are unknown. Understanding how organisms, their populations and communities will respond to interactions between climate and non-climate anthropogenic stressors is critical for preventing and managing further biodiversity loss.

Abstract: Extreme weather events can pervasively influence ecosystems. Observations in lakes indicate that severe storms in particular can have pronounced ecosystem?scale consequences, but the underlying mechanisms have not been rigorously assessed in experiments. One major effect of storms on lakes is the redistribution of mineral resources and plankton communities as a result of abrupt thermocline deepening. We aimed at elucidating the importance of this effect by mimicking in replicated large enclosures (each 9 m in diameter, ca. 20 m deep, ca. 1300 m3 in volume) a mixing event caused by a severe natural storm that was previously observed in a deep clear?water lake. Metabolic rates were derived from diel changes in vertical profiles of dissolved oxygen concentrations using a Bayesian modelling approach, based on high?frequency measurements. Experimental thermocline deepening stimulated daily gross primary production (GPP) in surface waters by an average of 63% for >4 weeks even though thermal stratification re?established within 5 days. Ecosystem respiration (ER) was tightly coupled to GPP, exceeding that in control enclosures by 53% over the same period. As GPP responded more strongly than ER, net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of the entire water column was also increased. These protracted increases in ecosystem metabolism and autotrophy were driven by a proliferation of inedible filamentous cyanobacteria released from light and nutrient limitation after they were entrained from below the thermocline into the surface water. Thus, thermocline deepening by a single severe storm can induce prolonged responses of lake ecosystem metabolism independent of other storm?induced effects, such as inputs of terrestrial materials by increased catchment run?off. This highlights that future shifts in frequency, severity or timing of storms are an important component of climate change, whose impacts on lake thermal structure will superimpose upon climate trends to influence algal dynamics and organic matter cycling in clear?water lakes.

Conference talk abstract: 

The regulation of rivers to provide water for food and fibre production has fundamentally and irreversibly changed the flow in rivers across the world. This has resulted in widespread impairment of freshwater ecosystems as patterns of flow are modified and flow volumes are reduced. Environmental flows seek to redress this impairment by specifically providing flows for ecological outcomes. A plethora of different approaches exist for setting environmental flow regimes ranging from setting minimum passing flows to more complex designer flow approaches which contain elements of the natural flow regime. In this paper, contrasting case studies from south eastern Australia are used to illustrate two vastly different approaches to environmental flow delivery. The first example is from the Snowy River system, an upland river system regulated for the provision of electricity generation and the inter-basin transfer of water. In this system, substantial inter-basin transfers have reduced the flow in the river to a fraction of pre-development flows. An environmental allocation is provided each year, the quantum of which is defined by a complicated set of rules, and the environmental flow regime for the entire year is set in advance using a variant of the flow scaling approach. Once the annual allocation is known, the historical flow record of a smaller analogous river is interrogated and the flow pattern from the year with the closest annual flow volume define the environmental releases. The intent is to enable a smaller river to become established within the framework of the older, larger river. The second example is from the Lachlan River system, a lowland river system of the Murray Darling Basin in which water is delivered to support food and fibre production. In this system, regulation and water use have removed small to intermediate sized floods, reducing connections with floodplains and wetlands. Spring and summer flows have increased as a consequence of irrigation deliveries. An environmental allocation is provided each year and actively managed throughout the year to provide events that target specific ecological outcomes (such as fish spawning). The intent is to protect ecological assets. Both river systems are located within the same state in Australia but are managed under markedly different legislative arrangements. The choice of environmental flow regime design reflects the human use of water in the systems. This has largely been driven by institutional structures and operational constraints around the delivery of water. While there are opportunities to learn across systems, these institutional and operational constraints limit the capacity for change and thus the environmental outcomes that can be achieved.

Thursday 31 Oct, 3.00-4.00pm, room 3B12, University of Canberra 

Snowy Hydro operates the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme which includes 9 power stations throughout the Snowy mountains of South Easter Australia.  The current generation capacity of the scheme is 5,500 MW.  As part of their objective for growing their portfolio of electricity generating capability, they are proposing to embark on a major project affectionately known as Snowy 2.0.  Snowy 2.0 is a major pumped-hydro expansion of the Snowy Scheme, which will increase the Scheme’s generation capacity by 2,000MW.  The project links two existing dams, Tantangara and Talbingo, through tunnels and an underground power station with pumping capabilities. Snowy 2.0’s pumping capabilities work in a ‘closed’ system – water is recycled between the upper dam (Tantangara) and lower dam (Talbingo) and the argument is made that the same water can be used to generate power more than once, making the most of available water. Snowy Hydro already has pumped-hydro capabilities at the Tumut 3 Power Station.

 

The EIS for Snowy 2.0 was put out for public comment on the 26th September with comments closing on the 6th November.  Running to more than 2000 pages, it has been roundly criticised by environmental groups for the damage that construction activities pose for Kosciuszko National Park. Our water science meeting will provide an opportunity to better understand the proposed scheme, discuss the implications for both water resources and conservation outcomes of both construction and operation and determine if there are sufficient issues to warrant a submission by our group.  For further details and more reading, please see the following documents.

Vegetated microhabitats are critical for avian access to arid zone waterholes


Simon E. Votto, Christine Schlesinger, Fiona Dyer, Valerie Caron, Jenny Davis

 

Long lasting waterholes provide resources and habitats that are essential for the persistence of many avian species in arid landscapes, especially in hot and dry periods when water demand is high. As air temperatures rise under climate change, pressure on waterhole access for smaller subordinate species is likely to increase as larger predatory birds begin to frequent waterholes more often to hunt. We investigated if vegetated microhabitats facilitate surface water access for terrestrial avian species during periods of high surface water demand when predation risk is high. Camera trap data were collected at six long lasting waterhole sites in West MacDonnell and Watarrka National Parks across three sampling seasons throughout 2018 and 2019. Recorded species were assigned to functional groups, including nectarivores, granivores, carnivores, omnivores and insectivores. Similarities between functional group daily trapping rates (DTRs) (collected by the cameras) and microhabitat variables (determined a priori) were analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Nectarivores, small omnivores and small granivores showed significant positive relationships with distance (decreasing) to nearest shrub and percent cover variables. Large granivores, large omnivores, carnivores and insectivores showed no significant relationships with habitat variables collected during the study. With the number of days exceeding 35°C likely to increase under predicted climate change scenarios it is probable that periods of high avian water demand and predation risk will increase in the future. Our results suggest waterholes surrounded by vegetative cover provide subordinate avian species with refuge from predators and increase opportunities to safely access the water during these times. 


A Interactive effects of multiple drivers on ecosystem metabolism in a large-scale lake enclosure experiment 


Darren Giling


Humans have drastically altered the transport and composition of material subsidies between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In lakes, eutrophication and brownification have resulted from increased concentrations of two dominant chemical regulators: phosphorus and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). However, the mechanisms underlying the interactive effect of these drivers on lake ecosystem functioning are not well understood because phosphorus and CDOM inputs to lakes are often concomitant, and emergent patterns may be the result of both direct physiological responses and indirect effects mediated by trophic interactions. We used manipulations in 21 large (1270 m3) lake enclosures in Germany (www.lake-lab.de <http://www.lake-lab.de> ) to disentangle how phosphorus and CDOM inputs affect whole ecosystem metabolism. Daily rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were modelled from high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration for six weeks following one pulsed addition of three levels of CDOM across a seven-step gradient of total phosphorus. Phosphorus and CDOM and addition had an interactive effect on autotrophic processes in the upper mixed layer; nutrients stimulated GPP only in the absence of light limitation that was induced by CDOM. ER showed a similar response, driven by a tight coupling to labile organic matter production by autotrophs in all treatments. However, there was also a small increase in the respiration of organic matter that was not coupled to GPP in enclosures with higher concentrations of CDOM. This effect partly offset the reduction in ER that was associated with lower GPP in darkened enclosures, producing an overall decrease in net ecosystem productivity (i.e. GPP – ER). Our results demonstrate that multiple drivers affect carbon cycling in lakes via a complex suite of physicochemical and biological mechanisms with implications for patterns of energy flow through the pelagic food web.


Differences in floodplain soil seed bank dynamics across hydrological gradients


Will Higgisson

 


Many (particularly annual) plant species which occur on floodplains produce a long-lived soil seed bank as a means of persisting through the temporally unpredictable hydrological regime. To understand the spatial and temporal distribution of plant species on floodplains, the role of hydrology, and the implications of changes to the hydrological regime because of water resource development requires knowledge of the potential species. As such, I investigated the effects of hydrological conditions on the characteristics of the soil seed bank of the floodplain of the lower Lachlan River. A seedling emergence experiment was conducted using soil collected from 25 sites from three typical floodplain habitat types (temporary floodplain lakes, intermittent river red gum swamps, and intermittent black box swamps) on the lower Lachlan River, which were subjected to four experimental treatments (rainfall, waterlogged soil, submerged, and receding). These experimental treatments represented typical conditions on a floodplain in a dry phase and during and following flooding. Soil was collected from 17 sites in May 2016, and a further eight sites in May 2017. Soil was recollected from 15 of the sites from 2016 and 5 of the sites from 2017 again in May 2019. During late 2016 and early 2017, the lower Lachlan River experienced the fourth largest flood event on record, and as such, soil collected in 2017 had been recently inundated. Soil seed bank density and species richness were compared to the number of floodplain-river connection events and time since flooding using 30 years of historic river flow data and commence to fill thresholds for each site. The density and species richness of seedlings was significantly greater on waterlogged soil than all other treatments. Seed bank density and species richness were significantly greater at sites which were connected less often compared to more regularly connected sites. Comparatively lower numbers of terrestrial species were present at sites collected in 2017 following flooding than sites collected in 2016. The number and density of terrestrial species had increased between 2017 and 2019. The density and species richness in the soil seed bank appears to initially deplete following flooding in response to germination and scouring but are then replenished once germinated plants reproduce and contribute more seeds, and the species that remain viable in the soil seed bank are those most tolerant of flooding conditions.

Effects of the insecticide Sulfoxaflor exposure on freshwater macroinvertebrates 

Insecticide use is extensive in agriculture. Neonicotinoids are a commonly used type of insecticide that can have detrimental effects on biota if they enter freshwater ecosystems. Sulfoxaflor (SFX, Isoclast™ Active) is a new systemic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor?modifying sulfoximine insecticide that is highly effective against a wide range of sap-feeding invertebrate pests, including those resistant to neonicotinoids and other insecticides. SFX and other neonicotinoids are agonists acting at insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors where the molecule irreversibly binds to the receptor within the invertebrate in such a manner that the receptor is permanently activated but this is not yet adequately understood. There is a critical lack of studies undertaken to assess the effects of sulfoxaflor on non-target freshwater macroinvertebrates. To gain a better understanding of the SFX mechanisms and the effects on freshwater macroinvertebrates I aim to determine: 1) the lethal and sub-lethal concentration response to the SFX in 10-20 freshwater macroinvertebrate species using Rapid Toxicity Tests; and 2) whether there is any evidence of irreversible binding resulting from SFX exposure by using microcosm toxicity experiments where I investigate taxa survival with SFX contrasted with Carbaryl (SevinTM) (a chemical that is known to quickly metabolise). The main questions addressed are:

1.      What is the approximate lethal concentration limit (LC50/x) for each freshwater macroinvertebrate species following exposure to SFX?

2.      What is the approximate hazardous concentration limit (HC5/x) for each freshwater macroinvertebrate species following exposure to SFX?

3.      What traits are exhibited by the tolerant and sensitive taxa following SFX exposure?

4.      Is there a change in freshwater macroinvertebrate behaviour such as immobility, feeding inhibition, swimming behaviour, and emergence as a result of exposure to the insecticide SFX in the mesocosms?

5.      Is there a difference between pre-exposure to SFX and no pre-exposure to SFX?

Preliminary results indicate that the SFX sub-lethal and lethal doses for the taxa tested range between ~0.2 ug/L and ~200 ug/L, and no differences were observed regarding the effects of receptor binding between of SFX and Carbaryl.

Abstract:

Climate change threatens ecosystem processes and has been associated with increases in mean temperature and temperature variability, which can have impacts to organisms directly and indirectly through community interactions (e.g. Vasseur et al., 2014; Paull et al., 2015; Sardiña et al., 2017). Despite predicted increase in temperature variability (Vasseur et al., 2014; Wang & Dillon, 2014), much of the climate change research to date has focused on changes in mean conditions, whilst largely ignoring potential effects of temperature variability (Thompson et al., 2013). I aim to fill this knowledge gap, by looking at competing mechanistic explanations of physiological tolerance, in order to understand the impact of climate change-induced thermal variability on freshwater macroinvertebrates and to understand mechanisms by which organisms have evolved to live in different climates. Therefore, I compare temperate (New South Wales and Colorado (Shah et al., 2017)) and tropical (Queensland and Ecuador (Shah et al., 2017)) freshwater nymph/larvae thermal tolerance traits (as critical thermal limits and acclimation ability) and include the effect of different temperature regimes on community interactions. I predicted that tropical insects have narrower thermal tolerances and are generally more sensitive to temperature changes compared to their temperate relatives and are thus threatened by climate change.

THE EMERGING ISSUE OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESIDUES IN FRESHWATERS: AN ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE

Professor Ross Thompson

There is growing evidence for the presence of pharmaceutical residues in freshwaters globally. I will review in brief these concerns and report on the effects of three major pharmaceutical classes; anti-depressants, stimulants and antibiotics on aquatic ecosystems. There is evidence for profound sub-lethal effects on aquatic diversity and ecosystems processes at concentrations representative of those found in the environment. There is also evidence for complex interactions when organisms are exposed to mixes of pharmaceuticals. I will draw these results into a context that speaks to the broader implications for human and ecosystem health.

Climate Change Effects on a Yukon Boreal Forest – 45 years of monitoring a terrestrial ecosystem

Charles Krebs

Climate change has helped us to reject the old idea of ecosystem stability. I will summarize a long-term study of a forest ecosystem in northern Canada and outline the changes that have occurred in the dominant plants, herbivores, and predators under a slowly changing climate. This ecosystem is similar to Australian systems in being a boom-bust ecosystem. But it differs from many areas in being nearly free from introduced species or direct human land-use changes in agriculture, forestry and mining, so that one could see the nearly clean signature of climate on populations and communities. Our results raise questions about how to monitor ecosystems in an era of much interest in long-term changes but little funding. Universities can play a large role in filling an ecological gap in monitoring climate effects.

SAGE is starting up for another year this Wednesday 13th Feb. Please come and enjoy the presentation to be given by Associate Professor Maja Adamska from the Research School of Biology, ANU.

 

Title: Developmental Genomics of Sponges

 

Abstract: Sponges are likely to be the earliest evolved animal lineage, making them key models in studies aimed at understanding evolutionary history of animal genomes. From the morphological and developmental perspectives, sponges combine features of single-cell eukaryotic organisms and the complex multicellular animals. Analysis of the first sequenced sponge genome demonstrated a limited number of homologues of genes involved in eumetazoan development, suggesting a gradual assembly of the complex animal developmental toolkit. However, sponges are a diverse phylum, composed of four distinct lineages. Taking advantage of the accessibility of next generation sequencing technologies, we have sequenced genomes of seven additional sponge species, including six calcareous sponges. For some of these species, we have generated an extensive collection of transcriptome datasets representing embryonic and postembryonic development and regeneration. Comparisons of gene content, with emphasis on developmental regulatory genes, demonstrated unexpected complexity and diversity of developmental toolkits among sponges, suggesting a significant gene loss and family expansions occurring independently in various sponge lineages. Usage of developmental regulatory genes demonstrated deep conservation of body plan patterning and regeneration mechanisms between sponges and other animals, while several conserved and novel genes are involved in formation of calcareous sponge skeletal elements.

Summary: Donate 20 minutes of your time to help us develop a database of published freshwater research results – the Ecological Evidence Exchange (EcoEvidEx).

One of the great frustrations of translating research outputs into management actions is the effort involved in extracting evidence from the huge and ever expanding amount of literature so that findings of many studies can be synthesized to inform management decision making.

A collaboration of researchers from Australia, the US, and Europe (https://freshwater-science.org/education-outreach/eco-evidence-exchange <https://freshwater-science.org/education-outreach/eco-evidence-exchange> ) is seeking to reduce this effort by establishing a database of evidence populated by study authors. Recently, the international journal Freshwater Science has approved a scheme where authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill out an evidence record as part of the submission of their final manuscript. However, we’re still finalizing exactly what questions might need to be asked, the form of answers, etc.

As an early test of usability, we’ve set up some test entry pages (on Google forms for the moment) at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd7k7SJRSf5IDFoTLkoPuH_4cmwggaEt7Zu_3WDcrVnSgc2Wg/viewform <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd7k7SJRSf5IDFoTLkoPuH_4cmwggaEt7Zu_3WDcrVnSgc2Wg/viewform> . We’d be very grateful if you could take 15-20 minutes to enter the results of one of your previously-published papers – an experimental or field observational study is best – and provide your feedback on the experience.

Some background, help documents and examples of ‘extracted’ papers can be found at https://freshwater-science.org/education-outreach/eco-evidence-exchange <https://freshwater-science.org/education-outreach/eco-evidence-exchange> . More on the project and our motivations for doing this can be found in this recent editorial published in Freshwater Science (https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/697965 <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/697965> ) and a brochure is attached.

Please join us to farewell our friend and colleague, Wendy, who is leaving us to start her fabulous new position as a researcher at CSIRO

 

Wendy will be sorely missed – not just for the tireless support she has given to the researchers and her wealth of experience and knowledge - but also for her sunny disposition and social inclination which has made all our lives richer as a result

??

 

We will meet at Stanley’s https://stanleys.net.au/ <https://stanleys.net.au/>  at 3:30 this Wednesday for drinks

Good morning, 

I have just come back from leave and feel I have many lose edits with bits of statistics work. I'm sorry for any inconveniences I have caused but it was a challenging time personally last year. 

To help start 2019 with a boost feel free to come by cafe momo anytime between 9am and 12pm today to talk statistics. :) In particular, what everyone would like to do with DataCamp? Shall we extend this or any other online edu tools? And I even have a new RMarkdown tutorial we can run though. :)

The best news is that the Statistics Network will continue in 2019 but I will be stepping back. There are many other great advisors and support the team will provide though! 

Thanks again for all your support!

Regards,
Anthony

	Hi Ali,

	 

	Ok that sounds good. I didn't know that I could have both laptops for the week. Can you drop it at my desk or do I need to sign stuff off with you? If so can we make it 11:30am at my office?

					Dear Ali,

					 

					I have attached the form you requested but this does not cover any of the software I want to install.

					 

					I have personally organised a meeting on Friday with regard to security matters of the programming I am doing currently. See below. 

					 

					Can you please have someone or yourself attend this so that we can ensure that the correct software and protocol are followed? If not then I will not know what I need to install within different local and remote repositories without this information.

					Hi Anthony.

					 

					Thanks for reaching out.

					UC doesn’t currently use static web generators, ruby or containers so we don’t have direct experience.

					That said we can offer some basic guidance.

					 

					Gem Updates

					If you are using a local instance of Jekyll for developing and publishing to Github pages.

					Then ensure you keep the local gems updated with Bundler.

					Ref: https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#keeping-your-site-up-to-date-with-the-github-pages-gem <https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/b9dZC3Q8kRTXwRjsgrMgC?domain=help.github.com> 

					 

					Gem/Open Source Vulnerability Management

					Perhaps take a look at Snyk which is designed specifically for open source vulnerability management.

					They have a free developer tier that could be useful.

					Ref: https://snyk.io/ <https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/dcvQC4QZlmTzy7ZfxIh4B?domain=snyk.io> 

					 

					Website Dynamic Basic Vulnerability Test

					We can potentially hit your website URL with Dorkbot which will do some basic OWASP detections.

					As you don’t have a database component SQLi won’t apply, but it could pick up other types.

					Ref: https://security.utexas.edu/dorkbot <https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/hcT_C5QZmnTMoWyUy4mdr?domain=security.utexas.edu> 

					 

					Meeting

					If you still would like to meet to discuss things further, Im free Friday morning.

					 

					Thanks

					Cheers

					Kieran

Black versus white: an evolutionary and ecological study of Australia's favourite bird


 <http://cdn-au.mailsnd.com/79253/va4yd4DM8WYriogBls1PHgwcIEqtInX0JKt26DioVw0/3053884.png> 


Prof Jane Hughes, School of Environment and Science at Griffith University

Many Australian birds show striking variation in plumage across their range.  The Australian magpie is one of the best known.  Its distribution covers most of mainland Australia and Tasmania, with male birds in the north having black backs and male birds in the south having white backs. In both the east and west, there are intermediate zones, where black-backed, white-backed and ‘hybrid’ birds occur.  In this talk, I examine the possible causes of this distribution and the explanation for its apparently stable structure.  I will describe a phylogeographic study across the entire distribution and a long-term ecological study in the eastern hybrid zone.

Metal hyperaccumulator plants - biological curiosities but a phytotechnological resource for soil clean-up and bioaccumulation of valuable resources


 <http://cdn-au.mailsnd.com/79253/_6tCoPBbCllOm3PLI78OaMhE2f8z_QHD6dC2_1vGGOI/3061146.png> 


Prof. Alan Baker, Honorary Professorial Fellow, University of Melbourne & Honorary Professor, University of Queensland

Hyperaccumulator plants take up and bioaccumulate metallic and metalloid elements to concentrations in the above-ground dry matter, frequently as high as several percent. These biological curiosities have now been found in several plant families from both temperate and tropical climates. Some 600+ are currently known for elements including nickel, zinc, cadmium, manganese, cobalt, arsenic, selenium, antimony, thallium and even rare earth elements. This presentation will review our current state of knowledge of these unique plants and how their extreme physiological properties are being harnessed in phytotechnological applications including soil clean-up, ecological restoration of mineral wastes, biorecovery and for agromining metals of economic importance.

Prof. Alan Baker will also be showing the documentary Superplants: How to make money by saving the environment, you can watch the trailer here <https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/ythyC91Zq6uV8AmuED5_X?domain=vision6.com.au> . This seminar will be longer than the others as the documentary is roughly 52mins long.

Are Australian rainforest species working past their temperature optimum?


 <http://cdn-au.mailsnd.com/79253/SokVwPnJANS6JkuX0Q4LiEmgSKIXgeJvhowprVc2-xE/3064945.png> 


Dr Kristine Crous, Western Sydney University

The Australian continent contains temperate, subtropical and tropical rainforests with unique species and biological diversity, but there are large uncertainties about their temperature responses and limits. Filling the gaps about their temperature response will help predict how vulnerable rainforest species may be to future warming. I measured photosynthesis-temperature responses of temperate and tropical rainforest species. I will discuss how much rainforest species function from their optimal temperature, and consider if they are well-adapted to their current temperature regimes, as well as the implications of climate warming for these species.

Who does actual work on Fridays anyways?

 

Careers coffee update: We’ve been steadily developing the scope for what makes a good CV and cover letter. This week we also covered some interview techniques. It’s been very useful, and more work than I anticipated – and I like to talk about myself…

 

For next week, I’m away Monday, so I thought we’d have a more relaxed Friday session.

 

The scope of Friday’s session will be polishing. We will mend the CV. For instance, we have the long format – a database of everything I have done, ever. And the short form – the reference list for our cover letters, tailored specifically for the dream postdoc we’re applying for. I’ll be writing the long one, and then finding a job as an example to write my short one, and a cover letter. And I shall continue my endeavor Monday. 

 

Please help me by joining so we can employ the psychological principle of ‘congruence’ (if we work in a group, we do more). I think. Else it’s distraction, but that’s also fun – and, again, it’s Friday.

 

Any academics can have a nosey in (I’ve invited Bill Maher specifically), but others are welcome ??

Please send me your coffee order. Note: we use ceramic mugs and not even the cardboard takeaway trays things, so your environmental impact is teeny. (Kefford will be proud.)

 

See ya there.

 

Cheers,

Kyle

Have you RSVPed for the Convivium on the 6th Dec? If you haven’t yet then please do so by COB on Friday 22nd Nov. Please RSVP by accepting the invitation in your calendar.  I have attached a draft agenda so that you will have an idea of what we will be doing that day. I encourage everyone to attend (staff and students). 

 

Last year we had a research showcase which was very well received so we will be doing it again this time.  The HDR students present each year in the HDR student conference so this is a chance for staff to have a go. This time I’m calling for volunteers to present a 10 minute talk. I particularly encourage postdocs to volunteer although all staff are welcome to volunteer. At the moment, there are 18 presenting slots available so get in quick to claim your spot.  The idea is to present your most significant piece of research from this year and/or where you see the most exciting opportunity lies for this research in future. Please let me know if you would like to present.

 

Regards, 

Janine

Water Science Seminar – Presented by LeRoy Poff (https://pofflab.colostate.edu/) 

Wed 6 Nov, 3.30-4.30pm, University of Canberra, Building 3, Level B, Room 12

 

Enhancing ecosystem function in heavily altered rivers 

LeRoy Poff is a professor in the Department of Biology at Colorado State University and holds a partial appointment as Professor at the Institute of Applied Ecology, University of Canberra. LeRoy received the prestigious Award of Excellence from the Society for Freshwater Science (U.S.) in 2019 in recognition of his excellent and extensive scientific contributions to freshwater scientific research and applications. LeRoy strives to develop the scientific understanding to inform sustainable management of rivers and streams in human-dominated landscapes.

LeRoy will present a recently published paper that describes the findings of a 5-year project funded by a municipal government to bring local university and federal science expertise together to ask the question of how proposed water development in a heavily modified but locally cherished river would alter the ecological condition and trajectory of the river ecosystem. Different hydrologic futures were simulated and the linked geomorphic-aquatic-riparian components of the system modeled to reveal trade-offs in ecosystem function that can be used to inform public conversation about possible development options and management interventions. LeRoy would like to make this presentation relatively interactive, as the data and methods used in this study were somewhat nonconventional but needed to address management of such complex systems. Attached is the recent paper to help prompt discussions.

All most welcome to attend (note this seminar is additional to our scheduled series of water science seminars).

Range of speakers (see full list below)

Eutrophication is a challenge facing environmental and conservation authorities worldwide. It upsets the natural ecology of lakes and can cause algal blooms and loss of other aquatic life. The consequences of eutrophication are predicted to intensify in coming years as a result a climate change.

The seminar will include presentations from three well known international scientists, each of whom are expert in the characterisation, control and management of eutrophication.

Facilitator / MC
Dr. Rod Ubrihien, Institute for Applied Ecology, Centre for Applied Water Science, University of Canberra

Speaker Profiles

Dr Miquel Lurling, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor in the Aquatic Ecology and Water Quality Management Group at Wageningen University who has for many years investigated and published papers on the different approaches to cyanobacterial management being applied in the Netherlands.  He was also the chairman of the Plankton Ecology Group at SIL for 12 years and, more recently (2016) was a co-founder of the SIL Working Group on Lake Restoration.  (https://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/Miguel-dr.ir.-MFLLW-Miguel-Lurling.htm <https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/r7kcCq7BORFpy4lSQEawu?domain=vision6.com.au> ).

Dr Gertrud Nürnberg, Ph.D., is an environmental scientist with more than 30 years of experience studying and modelling the geochemistry of lakes and reservoirs. She is the head of Freshwater Research, a limnological company focusing on restoration and modelling of eutrophic lakes and reservoirs. She has developed empirical models to predict water quality in deep and shallow lakes and reservoirs, including those that are polluted or anoxic. Past experience includes the determination of watershed and sediment loadings of nutrients and other pollutants, the establishment of lake nutrient objectives and TMDLs (Total Maximum Daily Loads) for municipal and state agencies, and the estimation of anoxia in more eutrophic waters.

Dr Tiago Ferreira, Ph.D., is an aquatic ecologist and the Director of Hydro Science http://hydroscience.com.br/ <https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/iDLxCvl0WqTDnBKtoWnq8?domain=vision6.com.au>  , Brazil, a company specialising in the restoration of lakes and drinking water reservoirs. Hydro Science has undertaken several large-scale projects on Brazilian lakes which have involved the use of Phoslock to control internal phosphorus cycling from sediments and cyanobacteria.   These projects, which have been undertaken on large urban lakes and potable water supply reservoirs subjected to high organic loads, have utilized Dr Ferreira’s advanced expertise in water quality modelling and limnological monitoring.

Dr Sarah Groves, PhD., is the General Manager - Technical at Phoslock Environmental Technologies (PET), Sydney, Australia. Dr Groves joined PET in May 2007 as Technical Manager. Her experience is in hydrochemistry, nutrient dynamics and aquaculture. Dr Groves previously worked for the CSIRO in the Marine and Atmospheric group in Brisbane, Australia. Her research to date has been particularly focused on nutrient dynamics, trace elements and heavy metal cycling in the environment, water quality in aquaculture ponds and its effect on farmed animals and the surrounding environment, groundwater and surface water geochemistry. Dr Groves plays a leading role in PET’s research and development work including registration, toxicity, liaising with universities and government institutions, reviewing new products and scientific testing.

We are well overdue for an IAE student social event (as was pointed out at yesterday’s SciTech HDR student town hall).  Not that we need a reason to get together but I would like to celebrate the success we have had in this year’s HDR student scholarship round because many of the scholarships awarded to IAE students are for those who are already here. Congratulations! I’m going to be a bit cryptic here until the students have received their formal letters of offer, which I believe will happen tomorrow. Once the letters of offer have gone out, I will let everyone know the names of those who were successful. 





We will provide pizza for lunch. For catering purposed, please let me know if you will be coming by accepting or declining this invitation and indicate if you have any dietary requirements. 





Hope to see you there!

Sex Across Dragons - Investigating Evolution and Ecology of Sex Determination Mechanisms in Agamid lizards through Cytogenetics and Genomics 


 <http://cdn-au.mailsnd.com/79253/WSRQyxs3n6cS1RnQTUdnZwmX6EoaXCvaH4Cyl2lwnEQ/3072759.png> 


Shayer Mahmood Ibney Alam,
PhD Candiate, IAE

Agamid lizards are commonly known as Dragons and there are about 500 species of these lizards under six sub-families distributed across Africa, Asia and Australia. This group is well known for having diverse modes of sex determination mechanisms including genotypic (GSD), temperature dependent sex determination (TSD) and GSD with temperature overrides.  The Australian species have shown evolutionary lability in sex determination by a number of transitions between different sex determination modes within short evolutionary time. Information from the other species from other regions remains largely unknown and during this presentation, Shayer will talk about how he addressed some of these knowledge gaps through his PhD works.

I have to sadly convey that Ronaq Varma has decided that he would like to move on to new adventures and leave University of Canberra. 

 

Ronaq has been an integral part of the Faculty Research team and has brought in enormous energy, enthusiasm, and unmatched commitment to excellent service delivery. He has worked with multiple Faculty Managers to support them on finance, bringing his excellent skills into play for the good of the Faculty. 

 

We are all extremely sad to see him go, but hope that someday he will consider coming back to the Faculty – when the time is right. The research team will undergo some changes but in this period, please direct any staff who needs support to SciTech-Research@canberra.edu.au <mailto:SciTech-Research@canberra.edu.au> 

 

Puran Singh will be managing finance related and post award matters and Daniela Peressini will be supporting on pre-award research support matters till we hire a new team lead. We will also look into interim support for the team till we hire. A farewell is being organised for Ronaq and an invite will be sent through soon. 

 

Kind regards

You may or may not be aware that we have an affiliation with the Australian Institute for Nuclear Science and Engineering AINSE. This means UC staff and students have access to:

 

*	the facilities at ANSTO (Lucas Heights campus) and the Australian Synchrotron
*	a range of undergrad and postgrad student scholarships, workshops and more 

 

Based on my new role as UC’s representative to AINSE, it’s clear that both UC, and many of our fields of science and technology in general are underrepresented in this space. My postgrads and I have had good experience accessing these grants and facilities, but it would be great to see this spread more widely.

 

Michelle Durant, the managing director of (AINSE) has just let me know that she is in Canberra tomorrow. I’ve arranged a visit to campus, where Michelle will present a brief run-down  and Q&A session on the organisation and facilities available from 12.30-1.30 in 3C12. All welcome.

Please find the updated room number. 

 

I have attached an agenda and relevant documents but please keep an eye out for an update and any other additional papers. 

 

Please note that we need a majority of student leaders to attend for  this to be a formal meeting – and to allow for the positions on the 2020 council to be elected. At present we do not have a majority. Please ensure that if you can attend in person, or conference call you make the effort. I have attached short PDS of the roles to provide an idea of the commitment required.

 

For those of you on campus prior to Wednesday please drop by IB136 (student centre) – I have folders for you all under my desk (another staff member can assist). It includes print outs of the roles so please avoid reprinting. 

 

Have a safe weekend. Either myself or Brad will access the SRC governance box before my return on Wednesday.

 

Regards

Sarah Bruen

I have heard second hand about the budget meeting on Friday.

I am unimpressed by the behaviour of the Dean to the extent where I suggesting the idea of boycotting the conference.

My reasons are as follows:


	*	Expectations around the budget were not clearly defined in a timely manner. 
	*	An initial acceptance of the budget in November, then a vague email about not meeting funding pre-Xmas, to the amendment the week before is poor management.
	*	Very stressful for committee members.
	*	Disrepsect to the volunteer committee members in person.

The behaviour of the Dean has no consequences unless we act upon it. Future students will be under this type of pressure (for an event that is forced upon us, and has great exposure for the faculty), which I think is unfair. 


Therefore I suggest putting an email that lists our reasons, and importantly how to rectify it for future student conferences, and we boycott the conference.


I suggest a meeting tomorrow, as if we continue this conference, we have a lot still to do anyways.


Cheers,
Kyle

The next Centre for Applied Water Science (CAWS) Research Meeting (20 Feb) will be a group discussion led by Associate Professor Ben Kefford on Ethics in reviewing, editing and responding to reviews. 

 

Abstract

Scientists are under a lot of pressure to publish and to have their work cited. In order to publish, our work must be evaluated, which usually involves anonymous peer reviewers and named editors. There is much trust placed in reviewers and editors, and there is generally no systemic assessment of this trust. My co-authors and I recently received a peer review, which requested citing four papers that appear to be totally irrelevant to our manuscript. One person is a co-author of all four papers and this person is on the editorial board of the journal. While it is possible that the reviewer accidently cited the wrong papers, it would appear more likely that the reviewer is suggesting citing these papers as he is an author of them, which will have the effect of boosting his citation output. I have had previous reviewers requesting that I cite papers and I have also suggested in reviews that papers (including my own) be cited. In all these cases the papers requested to be cited had a reasonable connection to the manuscript under review. At some point with all these and other questions going though my mind, I become aware of the attached papers and a recent scandal. In this scandal an unnamed person acting as both an editor and reviewer repeatedly pushed authors to cite their papers for at least two journals. Both my experience and the aforementioned two papers got me thinking about a range of questions, including: 

*	How common is it for reviewers to suggest citation of their own work? 
*	How often are the suggested citations the best papers to cite or even relevant to the paper? 
*	Is it ethical for reviewers to suggest citation of their own work? On one hand they could be making such suggestions with the aim to boost their citation count. On the other hand reviewers are picked because they are experts in the field of paper being reviewing and will in many case have authored highly relevant papers. Reviewers will of course have better knowledge of their own work than that of others and thus their own papers may come to mind quicker. And how much time should we expect (unpaid and busy) reviewers to give to a review?
*	What role do, and should, editors (and publishers) play? 
*	Is there technology that can be used to help detect (blatant) cases of unethical practices in reviewing and editing? And are these technologies being used?
*	What obligations do authors have when they are asked to cite papers that are not relevant or they don’t believe should be cited? Should authors just cite the suggested papers as the easiest road to publication, should they just say in their reply that the papers are not relevant or should they report such cases to the editor (or someone else)?

 

At this meeting, I hope to hold a group discussion about these and other related questions and issues. I request that participants think about these questions before the meeting and think about your experiences of the peer review process as authors, reviewers and/or editors. You may like to read one or both of the attached papers, although this is not essential. 

 

 

The CAWS research meetings are held 3.00-4.00pm fortnightly on Thursdays at the University of Canberra in room 3B12 (same as last year) - all most welcome to attend. These sessions can take the form of a seminar, a discussion focused on a research paper or other topic of applied water science relevance, and may include a multidisciplinary perspective of water related issues. If you wish to present or lead one of these meetings, please contact me (Sue Nichols, 6201 5408 | sue.nichols@canberra.edu.au <mailto:sue.nichols@canberra.edu.au> ). Alternatively, book in yourself using this link https://doodle.com/poll/5rs67edrhrs4etkt

This meeting is with Kirsten Zinner, Program Manager of Teaching and Learning; it will be a focus group / student consultation about Work Integrated Learning Guidelines and an Academic Policy Project that the Teaching and Learning and Students, Partnerships and International teams have been working on since (I think) November last year. This is a great opportunity to give feedback on guidelines and policy that is relevant to all our studies / coursework. 





Not all of you are required to attend, however, the more that are able to come the better. Kirsten will be sending out the papers for us to review very soon, so if you can’t attend you can still review the papers and send me your feedback so I can bring it to the focus group.

Medicating the environment: Behavioural and ecological impacts of pharmaceutical pollution on wildlife





Prof Bob Wong,
Monash University

Chemical pollution disrupts the balance of ecosystems, threatening the health of humans and wildlife everywhere. As one area of emerging concern, vast quantities of drugs taken by humans and animals make their way into rivers, lakes, and even drinking water. Here, I will discuss research highlighting the behavioural responses of aquatic organisms to pharmaceutical contaminants, and the ecological and evolutionary impacts that these disturbances engender.


When


11:30am - 12:30pm, Friday 6 March


Where


2B11


About Bob

Bob Wong is a behavioural ecologist and ARC Future Fellow based in the School of Biological Sciences at Monash University. Bob completed his PhD from the ANU and had two postdoctoral stints overseas (Boston Uni and Uni Helsinki) before joining Monash. Research in Bob’s Group focuses on mate choice and reproductive investment, and how human-induced environmental change affects animal behaviour.  Work undertaken in the group encompasses a wide range of species, from birds and humans to insects and fish.

Hi team

 

We’re up and running for 2020. 

 

We’ll be continuing on from last year’s wee project about SNPs and heterogeneity. (Pretty sure.)

 

And figuring out what scope we have for this, so if you’re new or haven’t been awhile, coming in today would be handy! 

 

3:30 3C53.

Kyle

Making the Invisible Visible through Environmental DNA: From Promise to Delivery, and Future Directors





Dianne Gleeson, EcoDNA Lab Group, Institute for Applied Ecology

Advances in DNA related technology in the form of environmental DNA (eDNA) hold significant potential for application to biosecurity and biodiversity. All organisms shed DNA and much finds its way into the environment and can be detected by sampling water, soil, air, or faecal material. The method of eDNA provides a non-invasive approach to surveillance and holds considerable promise for applications such as the detection of high-risk organisms of biosecurity concern and for biodiversity surveillance/assessment. The main risks lie in inadequate delineation of the limits of detection leading to the potential for incorrect diagnoses of species presences or absences and in the inadequate databases and systems to fully interpret the information that emerges from multispecies DNA profiles. However, challenges in the uptake of this technology is predominantly the development of agreed standards and guidelines which are essential in the provision of adequate quality assurance. In order to overcome some of the implicit challenges, we have developed a framework to estimate the sensitivity of both the field and laboratory components eDNA survey methods, and we have been able to demonstrate how this can be used to estimate the overall sensitivity of these methods for real-time applications. We have applied this framework to species-specific eDNA surveys to estimate the sensitivity, or probability of detection, for a range of species in Australia in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial settings. Examples from these applications will be presented, along with the current advances in eDNA technology such as real-time monitoring and point-of-site delivery.

Effects of extreme events on ecosystem functioning in lakes





Dr Darren Giling
Post Doctoral Research Fellow in Quantitative Ecology, IAE

Lakes play a significant role in carbon cycling at a global scale. An increased frequency and severity of extreme storms may alter lake productivity by disrupting patterns of stratification and importing terrestrial organic matter and nutrients. We used manipulations in large enclosures in a German lake to disentangle these mechanisms. The seminar will explore how brief events can induce protracted algal blooms that alter lake primary production and ecosystem respiration, highlighting that extreme events will superimpose upon climate trends to alter carbon cycling in lakes.

About Darren

Dr Darren Giling is a Research Fellow in Quantitative Ecology jointly in the Centre for Applied Water Science at the University of Canberra and CSIRO. He is an ecosystem and community ecologist focusing broadly on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. His research examines how environmental change influences the composition of biological communities and the rate at which they cycle energy through food webs. He is interested in whether management actions such as replanting native vegetation and providing environmental flows improve ecosystem health by restoring the connectivity of freshwaters to the surrounding landscape.

Career coffee is back for semester 1, 2020.

 

I welcome all those who are thinking about wider aspects of the scientific journey to attend.

 

Maybe you have a grant due.

A proposal to outline.

Yo CV to update. 

A cover letter to write. 

Interview techniques to work on.

Confused about what a postdoc is.

Confused about what a PhD is.

Collaborators to stalk/email.

Or, a 30-second pitch of who you are and what your research is on to practice. 

 

If it’s about the ‘logistics’ of navigating contemporary science, come along Monday at 9:15 – 10:30 upstairs in C353. 

 

Also, if you email me your coffee order, it’s on the house. (Thanks, Janine!)

 

Catch ya next Monday.

 

Cheers,

Kyle

As Janine mentioned in her email earlier this week, we are combining the Conservation Ecology peeps and the WGL’s on Friday afternoons to discuss science, updates on project progress, bring in guest speakers etc.  Janine will kick it off next week, leading a general discussion on the format of these meetings. Following discussions, we will be treated to a presentation from Dianne’s research student, Kymberly Crockett, called ‘Search for the Perch: Evaluating eDNA for the detection of a highly elusive species’.  And, if you really want to get in the mood, you can purchase Perch merch’ here: https://www.pozible.com/project/the-search-for-the-perch

 

See you, then!

For those who were unable to attend the student consultation meeting on 19 February, we just reviewed the Work Integrated Learning (WIL) Guidelines. This student focus group is to continue consultation with you on the Academic Policy Project, and feedback to you an update on the WIL Guidelines. We had agreed to schedule it for 26 February, however I am on leave that day, I hope this time suits.




Attached is some information relating to the academic policy typology (attachment 1), the project deliverable we will be discussing at this meeting. I've also attached the Academic Policy Project Plan, for pre-reading if you haven't already reviewed it.





Please fee free to send any queries to me by email.




With thanks

Testing the oxygen-temperature hypothesis of polar gigantism





Prof Art Woods, 
University of Montana

Ectotherms in polar seas are often larger than their warm-water relatives, a pattern known as ‘polar gigantism.’ Although polar gigantism has been ascribed to a variety of mechanisms, one idea—the oxygen-temperature hypothesis—has received significant attention in the past twenty years. It proposes that low polar temperatures depress metabolic demand for oxygen more than they depress supplies of oxygen to tissues, and that this shift releases polar organisms from oxygen-based constraints on body size. In this talk, I review conflicting evidence bearing on the hypothesis. In addition, I propose that the conflicts can be resolved by revising the oxygen-temperature hypothesis to account for short- versus long-term challenges to oxygen homeostasis. The revised hypothesis focuses on attention on the energetic costs of oxygen homeostasis and suggests that polar warming will disproportionately affect the largest-bodied species.

About Art

Art Woods is a Professor of Biology at the University of Montana, USA. His research leverages biophysical, physiological, and mathematical approaches to understand interactions between animals and their environments. His major projects include trying to understand global patterns of body-size evolution in relation to distributions of oxygen and temperature; how distributions of aquatic insect communities depend on interactions among stream temperature, oxygen levels, and flow; and the consequences of microclimatic variation for terrestrial insects.

The next Centre for Applied Water Science (CAWS) Research Meeting (5 March) will be a Masters Confirmation seminar by Seija Tuomi. All most welcome to attend.

 

Title: Effect of subsoil constraints on the chemical potential of soil potassium across a catena in an upland NSW South Western Slopes catchment.

 

Understanding the mobility of nutrients like K+ in the soil zone allows us to better understand the chemical and physical processes that make the element 'plant available', which in turn allows us to evaluate the likely flux that passes through the root zone and contributes to the salt load in interflow water. In upland catchments in southeast Australia streams that continue to flow through the dry summer months are likely to be gaining streams fed by interflow and/or baseflow. The interflow flux from the critical zone is one of the principle vectors for solutes to streams. Seija's study (supported by CSIRO Soils) looks in detail at the processes that dominate in the root zone, but enhances our broader understanding of the pathways for K+ transport across a typical catena. 

 

Abstract: The NSW South Western Slopes Bioregion is an extensive area of foothills and isolated ranges comprising the lower inland slopes of the Great Dividing Range extending from north of Cowra through southern NSW into western Victoria with an area of 8,657,426 hectares (NSW OEH, 2012). Three parallel relatively low-relief (typically <18%; Macdonald 1990) soil catena were characterised from Fairview Farm in the Harden-Murrumburrah area of central southern NSW (Macdonald et al., 2016), to identify the dynamics of soil K+ mobilisation and uptake by agricultural crops.

Across each catena 45 mm diameter soil cores were extracted to 2 m, at the crest, mid-slope and lower slope, with a dermosol, a chromosol and a sodosol identified on respective landscape facets. Soils forming a catena developed on low-relief hillslopes have less potential energy than those formed in steeper landscapes. For this reason the redistribution of mass can be dominated by subsurface flow of plasma, a combination of dissolved and suspended solids in soil water (Sommer et al., 2000; Bern and Chadwick 2010).

Potassium (K) has a dual role in terms of soil structure, it contributes to measures of soil salinity and it also serves as a plant nutrient. Measuring soil K availability has long been established in soil science (Goulding 1986), however, simply measuring the pore water exchangeable K+ concentration is not enough to establish the nutrient availability, because the energy at which the nutrient is supplied must be considered. The free energy-based K+ potential, Gibb’s Free energy, is calculated from the measured activity ratio of exchangeable soil K relative to the activity of other major exchangeable cations of Ca and Mg in J/mol. 

?GK = RT ln [aK / (aCa + Mg)1/2] 

From a soil chemistry perspective, the bioavailability of an element is also determined by the competition among the plant root system, soil solution and soil solid phases (Sposito 1989). 

This research looks at the role of soil K because it directly affects crop yield. Crop yield and quality relate to soil K potential (Marschner, 1995). Potassium is responsible for the maintenance of osmotic pressure and cell size in plants which in turn influences the efficiency of photosynthesis and energy production. Potassium is taken in, in relatively large quantities, by the growing crop at certain growth stages, normally earlier in plant growth than calcium and phosphorus. For example, wheat requires K after germination for the tillering and stem extension stages, and at heading and flowering, ripening and maturity for good protein production. 

This research explores how K+ supply to agricultural crops at the field site varies with soil mineralogy and what factors might potentially negatively affect nutrient supply. The study explores how sub-soil factors including: soil pH, sand versus clay content, primary and secondary mineralogy, and aluminium and manganese toxicity, influence the plant availability of soil K+.  Findings inform understanding of how crops access K+ and what form of K+ is plant available, what sub-soil conditions should be considered to optimise crop yield and what management practice improvements are suggested for rain fed cropping in a landscape where profit margins are low for the farmer.

We will be kicking off Eco meetings again this week with food and Mr. Kyle Hemming. Location 3B12 at 12:30.

 

Career coffee presents: how to write a bangin' CV and cover letter that will land you your dream postdoc.

 

How do you write about yourself achievements without sounding like a Donald Trump ad? Third person? Maybe not, Kyle. 

During this ECo meeting we will be going through how to do so for job fundaments: the CV and cover letter. 

We will discuss this in fours parts: we will cover the theory of CV, cover letter, job add using a handy science analogy. Next, we will go through the theory using a real-life example. Then have a quick perspective from our visiting thinker in residence, Charlie Krebs. And finally, open floor for discussion to address questions. 

 

Get down and have a chat and some fun.

 

Best,

Please see attached meeting agenda.  

We've got another jam packed meeting. Its looking like we might run over by about 15 mins, if you can't stay though, thats fine. However, we will do our best to sit to the schedule. 

** Please ensure that you read over the agenda prior to the meeting **

As I've written down the bottom of the agenda, if you're requesting funding, please complete a draft financial memo before the meeting and save to the SharePoint for review. 
This document can be found on the SharePoint:
Documents > Budget 2020 > Standard Financial Memo 

By completing this ahead of the meetings, everyone has a chance to read over before we meet and items are ready to be actioned. If you're unsure of the financial amount put an estimate in and we can further discuss at the meeting. 
This doesn't have to be the final copy, we can amend as needed. 

If you have any questions, please let me know! ?? 

Thanks, 
Keisha

Subject: CAA Fly Tying with Evan Jardine
When: Wednesday, 25 March 2020 7:25 PM-8:10 PM (UTC+10:00) Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney.
Where: https://us04web.zoom.us/j/270718378?pwd=VGJic1FudStqeTFKbktXeEtRVjNmQT09 <https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/sEj8C0YZ5qsGZANMcwSwrP?domain=us04web.zoom.us> 

 

Hi there CAA members,

This is an invitation to join us and Create-A-Fly Evan Jardine from 7:25 on Wednesday evening to tie a mud eye pattern to make the most of the hatch at Eucumbene and Jindabyne.  Raiders Weston telephoned this morning to say they are closed until further notice so the free conference application Zoom might be the way we will meet for a while.

To join us for fly tying, you first need to download the free Zoom application at https://zoom.us/download <https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/YtP6CgZoAYsApzEmIoys8M?domain=zoom.us>   then click on the Join Zoom Meeting link below.  You can practice and check that everything is working correctly by doing this in advance.  On Wednesday evening, just click the link again.  If the technology fails us, please be understanding.

Join Zoom Meeting 
https://us04web.zoom.us/j/270718378?pwd=VGJic1FudStqeTFKbktXeEtRVjNmQT09 <https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/sEj8C0YZ5qsGZANMcwSwrP?domain=us04web.zoom.us>  

Meeting ID: 270 718 378 
Password: 009099 

As Claude writes below, this is your opportunity to fly tie at home wearing your pyjamas and sipping your favourite beverage, clip some hair off your favourite pet and tie some amazing flies.

 

Regards to all,

 

Lyall

Canberra Anglers’ Association

*********************************************************************************

Howdy folks,

 

Apparently mudeyes will be the go-to fly for fishing the lakes this Autumn. We will be tying a simple but effective fur mudeye imitation.  There are numerous variations to this fly but we will try to keep it simple…but effective!

 

Due to COVID-19 concerns we will be trying something new…..a virtual fly tying session….you will be able to tie your fly in your “jimmy jams” in the comfort of your own home…with a glass of whisky in one hand and your bobbin in the other ??. You can also just join in to see what we are doing or have a chat. We will be using Zoom (a free video learning software application). 

 

 



 

 

The materials are:

 

*	Hook: 8-12  (jig if you want to use a bead)
*	Bead: 2.4mm or there abouts
*	Body: 

	*	Black Rabbit fur (substitute: Possum / craft fur?)
	*	Silver/purple Polar chenille (Substitute: dubbing)

*	Head: dubbing of your choice.

Have a test go before the meeting and let me know if you have any issues.  You should see something like below (although, hopefully not blue like me?!).  We may have a few teething problems but, it’s pretty straightforward so, I think we’ll get the hang of it pretty quickly!  Look forward to seeing you in a couple of hours ??

In light of the current global health situation, the Committee of Canberra Anglers' Association is pleased to invite everyone to a Zoom virtual meeting on Friday evening 3 April from 7:00 to introduce CAA to how we will be running our monthly meetings and fly tying for the time being.

You will need to download the latest version of the free Zoom application then click on the link below Join Zoom Meeting at the foot of this message.

If you have a friend who is an angler but is not a member of the club, but would benefit from getting together with us, feel free to forward this invitation to them.

We are currently trying to purchase a license which gives us unlimited duration meetings but such is the demand on the Zoom website that it is overloaded for the moment.

We intend that our Zoom sessions will be fun and welcoming so join us tomorrow evening to get a taste of meetings to come.

Regards to all,

People have asked me to send a reminder about tomorrow evening’s Canberra Anglers’ Association meeting featuring talk about an amazing trip to New Zealand so here it is.  Please forgive me if you are receiving this again and are not interested.  We are trying to give as many people as possible a chance to get our minds off of the bad stuff and on to the good stuff – you understand I’m sure. 

Claude, Bill and Peter will be presenting on Wednesday evening 8 April in lieu of our monthly meeting at Raiders Weston which is now closed due to COVID19.  They had an amazing trip to NZ with spectacular results in very trying conditions.  There will be no business meeting so it will be an all-fishing night!!!

Bill has been kind enough to offer to guide people through the Zoom process and set up so please contact him at blankie.blair@gmail.com <mailto:blankie.blair@gmail.com>  if you have any difficulties.

Kind regards to all and enjoy your angling,

Lyall

Suggested meeting etiquette:

*	Mute yourself when not speaking
*	For the sake of bandwidth, it’s probably best to have your camera off during the presentations
*	If you are asking a question it would be nice if you had your camera on, so we can see who you are.  But, if you are really shy, or having a bad-hair-day, can you please introduce yourself when speaking

 

All welcome!

Sorry just running 5mins late.

 

 

 

 

 

HI Richard,

 

I have totally tried that but mustn’t be sent up correctly. I have tried to dumb it right down so I can keep changing model structure and still use the other functions to input and output data. And so then from this I can run the following in an R script and produce the results (or just bits I want to look at).

 

lag.sp = 0

library(jagsUI)

##data import and setup

source(""./R/data_wrangling_script.R"")

source(""./R/model_data_setup.R"")

source(""./R/varInflation_fun.R"")

source(""./R/jags_model_function_run.R"")

source(""./R/jags_outputs_function_run.R"")

 

Does this time suit? 

 

Thanks heaps,

Anthony

Subject: RE: Simulations and other things coming up

 

Hi Anthony

 

Happy to catch up to discuss this.

 

In the first instance, I wouldn’t try simulating the model results using JAGS. Just write some R code to do it. Once you’ve fit the model to the data you should be able to use the resulting parameters to simulate the system just using the underlying equations. You might have to simulate seed production first as the background resource. Then the dynamics of each species can be simulated using the Gompertz model with the parameters from the model fit. It’s  a discrete-time model so you can simulate change in abundance for each species in each time step given the equations.

 

Cheers

Richard

Subject: Simulations and other things coming up

 

Hi Richard,

 

Hope you are well. I have just realised that I am giving a talk this Friday and not next Friday… I was planning on presenting a short work-in-progress seminar but I was worried there might not be enough time anyway. Can we have a meeting soon to discuss this? 

 

I have quite a few different options and don’t mind what one I clean up for Friday if you think there is a helpful discussion to have?

 

On the MPD data, I have been trying to simulate the full model but have been having trouble with:

 

       seed[i, j] ~ dnorm(mu.r[i, j], tau[3])

       mu.r[i, j] <- alpha1 + alpha2[i] + alpha3[j]

 

I have many simple jags simulations working (some examples attached) but can’t get much close to what we are using and have started trying to just put in limited data and running the model that way. Do you have any ideas? 

 

Regards,
Anthony

MAINTAINING ZERO PREDATORS


DEVELOPING WAYS TO REMOVE AND PROTECT

 <https://mcusercontent.com/9f2638134b89a0929e45f004e/images/62b26236-96e5-4d71-af26-e376949454fa.jpg> 
Once introduced predators are removed from a defined area how can they be prevented from reinvading and re-establishing a population? Use of a variety of barriers — both natural and 'virtual' — along with sensitive detection and response tools are all options being explored by Zero Invasive Predators (ZIP).

ZIP was established to develop innovative technologies that completely remove rats, possums and stoats from large mainland areas and then defend those areas from reinvasion. A model they call Remove and Protect.

Join Phil Bell, ZIP's Innovation Director, as he discusses some of the tools and technologies they have been exploring to defend an area from reinvasion.

Please join us for this week’s virtual GEM presentation featuring a one-man-show, Anthony Davidson, who will be giving the following talk:

 

Title: 

Fitting state-space models to multi-species CR data.

Overview: 

The success/failure of control programs globally highlight the importance of accounting for interacting invasive species when undertaking pest control. For example, the removal of cats (Felis catus) from Little Barrier Island in New Zealand resulted in decreases in the native seabird of importance. This was attributed to increases in the rat populations released from predation after cats were removed (termed mesopredator release). The recent advancements in fitting Bayesian State-Space models allows us to fit CR models to estimate dynamic processes such as interactions between multiple species through time. We use this approach to compare and simulate the effects of different control measures on mice, rats and possums in a New Zealand native mixed-forest. These results help to guide management discussions based on both the observed data and the underlying multi-species dynamics.

Please hold this time for a trial run for the SRC Town Hall. 

 

The link for the trial today is: https://au.bbcollab.com/guest/2efe95ffb44349b392ad7371ae6483db <https://au.bbcollab.com/guest/2efe95ffb44349b392ad7371ae6483db>  

 

Please note that this is not the same virtual room that we will be using for the Town Hall this evening. We are only using this room for the test as it is a private room. 

 

The test today will allow us to do a quick run through of proceedings for the Town Hall and to demonstrate the use of Blackboard Collaborate for those that have not used it before. When you join I will convert your role to moderator so you will have the same functionality as you will at the Town Hall. 

 

Warm Regards,

Meaghan

Suggested meeting etiquette:

*	Mute yourself when not speaking
*	For the sake of bandwidth, it’s probably best to have your camera off during the presentations
*	If you are asking a question it would be nice if you had your camera on, so we can see who you are.  But, if you are really shy, or having a bad-hair-day, can you please introduce yourself when speaking
*	BYO refreshments ??

 

All welcome!

*	a strategy to use CBA ignition grants to help build to something bigger and/or fund student projects. 
	
*	funding opportunities for ECRs, including Herman Slade grants for projects funds and  ARC DECRA Fellowships. 
	
*	funding opportunities for students
	
*	ARC Discovery and Linkage Projects

Changed: Would you like to know the secret to high output, low stress scholarly writing? In academia it is often assumed that writing comes naturally. However, an overwhelming body of research shows that there are very clear and practical strategies that can greatly increase your writing productivity.
This workshop will help you to understand:

*	why it's hard to get started

What is Shut Up & Write!?
Basically Shut Up & Write! is a writing group that not only helps you get words written but is fun, social and supportive. Academia can be a lonely business if you let it.
Writing groups have magical powers for graduate students and researchers: they can boost the quality of your writing, keep you going when you're distracted or despondent, accelerate your productivity, increase your confidence – as well as kickstart many of the essential skills required in a research career. Plus, they offer a lot of other benefits to help you survive and thrive (Aitchison and Guerin, 2014). 

What's involved?
Using the 'Pomodoro Technique', we'll spend 25 minutes writing in silence followed by a ten-minute break where you can chat with others, share ideas or go for a walk. We'll repeat this cycle four times and you will be amazed at just how much you can achieve in two hours. 
To help you focus your writing and maximise productivity, it helps to have specific goals (i.e. section of a paper or chapter and number of words). 
We also encourage you to put your phone on silent and stay off the internet during writing time.


Want to know more? 
Read this blog post by Dr Tseen Khoo from The Research Whisperer on the benefits of Shut Up & Write! 
Research also indicates that participating in group writing generates many positive outcomes, see Shut up and write! Some surprising uses of cafes and crowds in doctoral writing

Good morning beautiful friends,

 

Thanks to everyone who have emailed me back their availability.

Attached is a meeting invite via MS Teams.

 

I would like to clarify that this meeting is a consultation meeting and not considered as part of our roles at SRC. We basically want to hear from you the things that AB Council should be aware of. Therefore, we are keen to hear/learn from each one of you in order to be able to translate/articulate these ideas and recommendations to this Council.

 

Some of the things we would like to discuss together in this meeting as follows:

*	Identifying the issues from COVID-19 faced by students
*	Student feedback regarding migrating to digital learning
*	Lesson learnt from COVID-19

 

We are keen and open to any suggestions that you may have about these topics and any other matters you may want us to work together on. So, we look forward to speaking with you all soon.

 

Please let me know if you have any questions. Have a good day.

 

 

Regards

Subject: Meeting request 

 

Hello friends,

 

Hope all is well and good. 

I understand some of us are having final assignment submissions and preparation for final exams if there is any. So I wish you all the best with these busy times.

The reason of this email actually is to seek your help and collaboration, as part of our roles at Academic Board, it is expected from the student members to report to the council twice a year, therefore, Josh and I are trying to compile some ideas, identifying issues, and recommendations to enhance the experience of our students. 

Compiling those ideas would not happen without your amazing insights, so can we arrange for a meeting this week if possible please? 

Please send me what is your availability on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. 

 

FYI: the deadline is next week(20/5).

 

 

Regards

Suggested meeting etiquette:

*	Mute yourself when not speaking
*	For the sake of bandwidth, it’s probably best to have your camera off during the presentations
*	If you are asking a question it would be nice if you had your camera on, so we can see who you are.  But, if you are really shy, or having a bad-hair-day, can you please introduce yourself when speaking
*	BYO refreshments ??

 

All welcome!

Please join us for this week’s virtual GEM presentations featuring Jack and Peter who will be giving the following talks:

 

3:30

Jack Rojahn

Applications of Environmental DNA methods for urban ecosystems research

3:50

Peter Unmack

*Watt the hell!  Why is my electricity bill so expensive?

*Request from Peter:

Just to mix things up, for my GEM lab meeting talk next Friday I thought I'd talk about energy use in the home as it's become a bit of a hobby of mine over the last couple of years.  Plus if you are lucky you will save some money too, but to do this I need people's latest electricity bills, either the pdf copy or a photo of all the pages.  I'll keep it all anonymous, but the more bills I can get the more informative the talk will be, and the better chance I can save you some money.  I'll need people to also tell me what gas appliances they have, if any and whether they have solar.

Suggested meeting etiquette:

*	Mute yourself when not speaking
*	For the sake of bandwidth, it’s probably best to have your camera off during the presentations
*	If you are asking a question it would be nice if you had your camera on, so we can see who you are.  But, if you are really shy, or having a bad-hair-day, can you please introduce yourself when speaking
*	BYO refreshments ??

 

All welcome!

Suggested meeting etiquette:

*	Mute yourself when not speaking
*	For the sake of bandwidth, it’s probably best to have your camera off during the presentations
*	If you are asking a question it would be nice if you had your camera on, so we can see who you are.  But, if you are really shy, or having a bad-hair-day, can you please introduce yourself when speaking
*	BYO refreshments ??

 

All welcome!

Hi Anthony,

 

How are you going? Could you kindly share the name of the application you are using for your data analysis please?

 

Following is some more information that would be helpful for your consideration. In some cases, there is possibility to replace the JRE plugin by OpenJDK (open source – free.) DITM have been successfully converting our Student SOE to use OpenJDK instead of the costly JRE plugin… Some staff have also decided to move to OpenJDK as well.

 

The OpenJDK has been recently available in Software Center for staff to use – explore.

 

To comply with licence legal policy, if users really need to keep JRE, we would need to get approval from authorities to negotiate suitable licence.

 

Kind regards,

Minh Nguyen

List of applications that are popular (many UC staff and HDR students are using) and do NOT need JRE

 

*	SPSS
*	Nivo
*	EndNote
*	R & RStudio
*	TechnologyOne / FinanceOne
*	Others…

	*	Eclipse needs JRE, but can be configured to use OpenJDK
	*	GraphHopper needs JRE, but can be configured to use OpenJDK
	*	Gephi needs JRE, however there is a chance to replace JRE by OpenJDK

Dear Anthony,

 

Thanks for your email.

 

We got info from ORACLE Java that the JRE version installed on the PC are no longer free & not sure how long the vendor would allow users to use paid licensed software without paying fees! Therefore, It would be great if you could discover ASAP the possibility to replace the JRE plugin by OpenJDK (open source – free.)

 

In case users really need to keep ORACLE JRE on their PCs for work, it would be great to get approval from their managers and or their faculty’s division’s authorities.

 

P/S: DITM have been converting our Student SOE to use OpenJDK instead of the costly JRE plugin and we have been successfully doing for some software…

 

Thanks

Cheers,

Hi Minh,

 

Yes I use it for building shiny applications for my data analysis. But I am not an expert so maybe you could explain how best to setup this pipeline without it.

Anthony

Importance: High

 

Dear Anthony,

 

I hope you are well.

 

Due to recent software licensing changes to the Java Runtime Environment (plug-in), it is no longer free for educational use. DITM are currently conducting an audit, your following PC has been identified as one that currently has Java installed.

 

DITM will soon begin removing Java from staff machines, unless of course you require it. In most cases Java isn’t used directly, but is often used by other software. Some examples are; Callista admin users and Ascender admin users.

 

If you believe you still require Java, please let us know. Or if you are unsure if you require it, please reply to this email.

 

Kind regards,

After a short break and an exponential education in using online learning and communication platforms, we are back! I am aware that most of you will have had significant changes to your research plans and I am really keen to re-connect with everyone and figure out how we can work together.
 
I have chosen a random day during (hopefully) lunch to have an online meeting. The meeting agenda is to introduce everyone to everyone, and introduce the research that you are doing or hope to be doing. I am also keen to hear about some of the methodologies and methods that people are either investigating or proposing to use.
 
Please see below the link to the Zoom meeting, and also note that there is a password required.
 
Yours in qualitative research,
Thomas

I’m cancelling this week’s research workshop as I think we’ve pitched all of our ideas for now. 





It’s likely that there will be a round of  CBA ignition grants and synthesis groups announced soon. It would be good to start thinking about ideas and potential collaborators from CSIRO or ANU. The grants might be small but they could lead to bigger things.

Abstract

Condition benchmarks: characterising good condition and developing multi-scale approaches for evaluating non-woody vegetation outcomes in wetland-floodplain systems

Wetland and floodplain environments in the Murray-Darling Basin support a tremendous diversity of plants and vegetation communities, with more than 600 plant species occurring across the Basin. Assemblages vary over space and time providing heterogeneous and unique communities. Wetland and floodplain plants, and the communities they form, are fundamental to river-floodplain systems. Their importance is reflected in the Basin Plan and via objectives in the Basin-wide Environmental Watering Strategy. The decline in the extent and health of vegetation in the Murray-Darling Basin is well documented. This, along with the health of other biotic groups, is a key driver in the recovery and delivery of environmental flows.

Due to the dynamic and variable nature of non-woody vegetation responses, evaluating Basin-scale outcomes to flow regimes, including environmental flows, is challenging. The heterogeneity of responses, such as richness and composition, makes it difficult to scale outcomes to the Basin. Additionally, the current ability to extrapolate outcomes to unmonitored areas, a pragmatic reality due to finite funding, has limited application. Water managers are required to report on progress towards meeting Basin Plan objectives and are doing this in the absence of defined benchmarks or definitions of good condition. This hinders the ability to communicate outcomes to the broader public, which is vital given the contentious nature of environmental watering. 

The overarching aim of the research project is to characterise good condition for non-woody wetland and floodplain vegetation at different levels of ecological organisation and different spatial and temporal scales. Based on the attributes used to characterise good condition, condition benchmarks will then be developed, along with a multi-scale approach for evaluating non-woody wetland and floodplain vegetation outcomes to flow regimes.

 

Bio

Cherie Campbell is a vegetation ecologist based in Mildura, Victoria. Cherie is interested in the sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems, particularly the Murray-Darling Basin, including the efficient and effective use of environmental water to deliver ecological benefit. 

Cherie has worked on inland floodplain systems since 2008 as part of the Centre for Freshwater Ecosystems (formerly the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre). She has contributed to projects such as The Living Murray (TLM) program, the Long-Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project and the Environmental Water Knowledge and Research (EWKR) project. She has also undertaken a number of other projects looking at the response of understorey vegetation and lignum to different flow regimes and the application of environmental water.

Cherie is a member of the Flow MER Vegetation Theme and will contribute to the Basin-scale evaluation of vegetation outcomes as well as vegetation-related research – which forms her PhD. As a PhD student with the University of Canberra Cherie will develop a framework of condition benchmarks and a process for evaluating outcomes for non-woody wetland and floodplain vegetation at a Basin-scale.

Meeting ID: 823 2976 8488

 

 

Hi there CAA members,

 

Jason Q has been kind enough to host virtual fly tying on Wednesday 24 June from Australia’s winter capital Cairns!!!  The tying materials list is below and JQ has detailed lots of materials options at the foot of this e-mail so there is no excuse for not joining us for virtual fly tying on Zoom.

 

 

 

CAA Cormorant

 

Basic Tools:  Bobin, whip finisher, sharp scissors.

Hook - Any nymph/ lake hook size 12-18 

Thread:  8/0 black or, **any colour depending on what colour people want their fly to be.  And maybe a fluro yellow, orange, pink, red acting as a 'hotspot' or cheeks. Keep the thread small as the fly is pretty small.  6/0 is ok, but still pretty thick.  

Body:  Tinsel - Gold, silver, red, copper, blue, green (med) - Whatever colour people like for a body.  Any colour thread even!

Body Rib:  Small/ med wire - or stripped peacock quill. 

Wing:  Marabou or rabbit zonka - colour of people's choice

Cheeks:  Jungle cock or medium sized tinsel for cheeks.. Goose biots are very good too. We can even use fluro thread..

Varnish, nail polish or UV resin..  no preference.  And BeesWax for thread

 

Notes/ Tips:  

Below are some notes & tips from my experiences.  - You might find them useful..

1.  We often buy tying gear because a recipe insists on something** but we can easily substitute that 'something' with an equivalent or like product.  Our gear becomes more consolidated, reducing gear that we may only use a couple of times.  Our money will go much further allowing you to spend more elsewhere!    I will go through some flies where you will use these materials again and again.  

2.  Buy a hank of Flashabou tinsel (Code: 6998) or, Polarflash (Code: 2015) rather than bobbins of tinsel..   Works out much cheaper and you get heaps of colours in your hank of tinsel.. You can use it for cheeks but it is pretty narrow. Buying hanks of flashabou etc. allows you the opportunity to use it in your wooly buggers, humongous, shreks etc, even collars, nymph cases, ribbing etc.  

3.  SPOTLIGHT or Craft stores have Goose Biots and they have like a pack of 10 with 2x red, 2x blue, 2x yellow, 2x white and 2x green?  If not, get on to Troutlore.com.au <https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/glhNCWLJ5OTjyZAPsx1era?domain=nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com>  and checkout Rob's Hareline range. 

4.  Colours/ variants are endless for this fly..  If you haven't got the exact materials we can substitute it and it'll still be a fish-catcher.  We can go through some variants on the night.

5.  EP Streamer Brush is also very handy - Orange in particular is very productive in local lakes.  Check out Craig Dawson write up in the book Australian Trout Flies 'revisited'.  And then the streamer brush is good for cod flies, salt and many other flies..

6.  UV resin is great for instant completion to your flies, but has a nice price tag and a UV light is required.  Most of the time $5.00 Sally Hansens is more than fine and is as robust.  Sally Hansens does smell and so do some UV resins.  The choice is yours! 

7.  Jungle cock is difficult to obtain these days (limited supply), suppliers have plastic printed ones. Or we can use tinsel or biots. 

8.  Fish these anywhere in your team of flies. Swing them, Tweak them.. 

 

See you there..

 

Cheers

 

JQ

Fileless attacks are some of the most misunderstood attack vectors in the cyberthreat landscape. With so many different criteria of what actually makes an attack vector fileless, it’s no wonder that security teams struggle to identify and detect fileless attacks in order to determine the best way to protect their environment. In this live demo we will discuss the various ways attackers carry out fileless attacks and show you how Deep Instinct is designed to neutralize all of them.

Presenter: Dr. Lewis Collins, Editor-in-Chief, One Earth (A Cell Press journal)

Learn techniques and strategies for publishing in highly selective journals with Dr. Lewis Collins, Editor-in-Chief of One Earth (a Cell Press journal). Dr. Collins will share tips on developing your papers for premium publications, elaborate on his experience of working with researchers and authors throughout the research publishing cycle and the opportunity to broadly disseminate findings. Dr. Collins will also share more details about the growth of Cell Press journals in the physical and environmental sciences field, including the launch of many new titles such as Chem, Matter, Joule, and One Earth. He’ll outline Cell Press’ approach to high-demand, multi-disciplinary content, and expanding OA publishing strategies at Cell Press. Join this engaging webinar to find the answers to your pressing questions in the Q&A session during the webinar. Don’t forget to extend this invite to your colleagues who might find this of interest.
About Lewis Collins:
Inspired by David Attenborough documentaries as a child, Lewis has been amazed by the natural world from an early age. While undergraduate and master’s degrees in Earth science (Cardiff University), and Climate Change (University of East Anglia) nurtured this interest, it was doctoral (British Antarctic Survey) and post-doctoral (Université Pierre et Marie Curie) research on Antarctica that centered his focus on environmental change. Prior to launching One Earth, Lewis spent over 5 years with Nature Communications, where he led the Earth editorial team and curated, commissioned, handled (and occasionally rejected…) research across the full spectrum of Earth and environmental science. Lewis is particularly interested in grand challenges associated with land-use and the competing demands for this increasingly scarce resource.","BrightTALK",,"Normal","False","Normal","2"

Suggested meeting etiquette:

*	Mute yourself when not speaking
*	For the sake of bandwidth, it’s probably best to have your camera off during the presentations
*	If you are asking a question it would be nice if you had your camera on, so we can see who you are.  But, if you are really shy, or having a bad-hair-day, can you please introduce yourself when speaking

 

All welcome!

It has been suggested the SRC meet with marketing to discuss the branding of the UCSRC. 

 

Please consider the pro’s and cons of having branding that links you with UC or has you seen as a separate entity. The long term goal is to create a design brief that applies to SRC, CURIEUX and Advocacy and is passed on to future councils. 

 

Due to numbers available the meeting will be via teams. 

 

Please note I am on leave but available to discuss prior on Monday or Tuesday. 

 

Cheers

Sarah

Due to the Stage 3 restrictions being postponed by the ACT Government last week, we have decided to postpone the meet and greet in the refectory on Thursday morning.

 

The VC looks forward to engaging with staff over the coming months when the further easing of restrictions takes place.

Suggested meeting etiquette:

*	Mute yourself when not speaking
*	For the sake of bandwidth, it’s probably best to have your camera off during the presentations
*	If you are asking a question it would be nice if you had your camera on, so we can see who you are.  But, if you are really shy, or having a bad-hair-day, can you please introduce yourself when speaking

 

All welcome!

 

FOR THOSE OF US MEETING ON CAMPUS, PLEASE JOIN US FOR DRINKS AT THE WELL, FOLLOWING THE PRESENTATIONS ??

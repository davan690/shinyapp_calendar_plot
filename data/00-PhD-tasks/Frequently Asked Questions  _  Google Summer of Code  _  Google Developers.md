## General[](#top_of_page)

### Is Google Summer of Code (GSoC) a recruiting program?

No. If you are interested in working for Google, please visit the [Google jobs website.](http://www.google.com/about/careers/)

### Is GSoC considered an internship, a job, or any form of employment?

No. GSoC is an activity that the student performs as an independent developer for which they are paid a stipend.

### Are mentoring organizations required to use the code produced by students?

No. While we hope that all the code that comes out of this program will find a happy home, we don’t require organizations to use the student's' code.

### Where does GSoC occur?

Google Summer of Code occurs entirely online; there is no requirement to travel as part of the program.

### What can I do to help spread the word about GSoC?

You can download [flyers](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/marketing) to post around your campus. You can also tweet about the program, make YouTube videos, or host a meetup or information session in your area. We also have a [template email](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/marketing) you can use to distribute to your community (school, developer, etc.) and other contacts.

### How do I organize or host a GSoC information session or meetup?

You are welcome to schedule a meetup at whatever time and place is convenient for you! Please review the [Program Rules](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/rules) first and utilize our [presentation template](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/presentations) and flyers.

### Can I participate in GSoC as both a mentor and a student?

No. We want to make sure that each project and student receives sufficient attention, and we feel this could create a bad experience for those involved. Please choose whether participation as a mentor or a student is more appealing to you and plan to apply accordingly.

### What if I have more questions?

Check out the [Student Guide](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/guide#student_manual) and other pages on [this site](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/).

If after reading through all the documentation you still don't have an answer please consider reaching out to the GSoC community via IRC or the discussion list. Visit the [Contact Us](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/contact) page to find out how.

## Students[](#top_of_page)

### When can students apply for GSoC?

Please see the [program timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) for more detailed information.

### What programming language(s) should I know to participate in GSoC?

The programming language you need to know depends on which organization you are interested in working with. You should be familiar with the programming language(s) used by that organization.

### Can I submit more than one proposal?

Yes, each student may submit up to three proposals. However, only one per student may be accepted. No more than one proposal per student will be accepted, no matter how many proposals you submit.

### Can students already working on an open source project continue to work on it as part of GSoC?

Yes, but students should be sure to note their previous relationship with the project in their proposals.

### Can a group submit a proposal together to work on a single project?

No, only an individual may work on a given project.

### Should I send proposals directly to the mentoring organizations?

No, all proposals should be submitted to the program site. Proposals submitted outside of the Google Summer of Code program site **will not be considered** for Google Summer of Code.

### What are the eligibility requirements for participation?

*   You must be at least 18 years of age when you register
*   You must currently be a full or part-time student (or have been accepted and committed to the fall term) at an [accredited](#accredited) university as of the [date accepted student proposals are announced](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline)
*   You must be eligible to work in the country you will reside in during the program
*   You have not already been accepted as a Student in GSoC more than once
*   You must reside in a country that is not currently embargoed by the United States. See [Program Rules](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/rules) for more information.

### Will you make an exception for me?

No. We cannot make an exception if you do not meet the eligibility requirements, no matter how talented or interested you are. Thousands of students apply, and making an exception for you wouldn't be fair.

### What forms will I need to provide?

All applicants will need to provide [proof of enrollment](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/proof-of-enrollment) to an [accredited](#accredited) educational institution.

Accepted participants will need to provide appropriate [tax forms](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/tax-forms).

### I am an accepted student in the United States on an F1 visa. How do I get authorization to participate?

Please talk to your school's international student affairs office for more details. Google can not provide you with any kind of CPT or OPT authorization.

All accepted participants will receive an email confirmation of acceptance. We do not offer customized letters.

### How do I know if my school is “accredited”?

You can learn more about accreditation for universities [here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_accreditation) Please note that participating in online courses, even if they are with accredited universities, does not alone constitute enrollment. You must be/will be enrolled at the university.

Yes, we hope you do! You just need to show the proof of enrollment in your college program.

### I graduate in the middle of the program. Can I still participate?

Yes, as long as you are accepted into or enrolled in a college or university program as of the date accepted students are announced, you are eligible to participate in the program. Students must provide proof of enrollment during the proposal period.

### Do I get paid for participating in GSoC?

Yes! Google will provide a [stipend](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends) to those students who successfully complete the program.

### Will I get paid even if the organization does not use my code?

Yes, so long as the student passes their evaluation(s). Whether or not the project uses the produced code does not impact the student stipend.

### What does a good student proposal look like?

The [Student Guide](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/guide#student_manual) has a section on "Writing a Proposal".

The best proposals are from students who took the time to interact and discuss their ideas with the organization **before** submission. Be sure to include the following: detail on exactly what you're proposing, why you're proposing it, the reason you're qualified to do it, and your development methodology. It should also include details of your academic, industry, and/or open source development experience.

### How much time does GSoC participation take?

You are expected to spend around 30+ hours a week working on your project during the 3 month coding period. If you already have an internship, another summer job, or plan to be gone on vacation for more than a week during that time, GSoC is not the right program for you this year.

### Can I earn course credit for participating in GSoC?

Possibly, that depends on your school's requirements.

### Can the schedule be adjusted if my school ends late/starts early?

No. We know that the schedule doesn't work for some students, but it's impossible to make a single timeline that works for everyone.

Some organizations may allow a participant to start a little early or end a little late -- but this is usually measured in days, not weeks.

The monthly evaluation dates cannot be changed.

## Mentors/Organization Administrators[](#top_of_page)

### I want to learn more about participating as a mentor in GSoC. Where can I find more information?

Read the [Mentor Guide](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/guide#mentor_manual) and the [Program Rules](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/rules) for more information on becoming a GSoC mentor.

### What are the eligibility requirements for a mentoring organization?

To be eligible to participate as a mentoring organization, you must be a group running an active free/open source software project, e.g. [BRL-CAD](http://brlcad.org/). The project does not need to be a legally incorporated entity. Mentoring organizations must have _already_ produced and released software under an [Open Source Initiative approved license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses) and have at least two contributors to serve as organization administrators and/or mentors for the entire program in order to participate in the program.

### Do organizations receive any money for participating in GSoC?

Organizations in good standing will receive 500 USD per accepted student at the end of the program. This is regardless of whether the student passes or fails.

Organizations are free to use these funds as they wish.

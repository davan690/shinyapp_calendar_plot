# Calendar repository

To begin with this repository contains the code and data needed to create timelines for the next 6 months of my life. This happens to include a series of side projects, my PhD finalisation and other small community projects. I have also included impacts of Covid19 and the council work I am undertaking over the year of 2020.

## Baseline dataset

The general dataset has to include the following:

```{r}
# import data
# names/column headers 
namedData <- 
```

The idea of a baseline dataset and the conceptual structure of a `tidyPipes` project are incorporated within the code here is well. 

The idea about this project is it will allow graduates that do not commonly use `R`, `RStudio` and the other features of statistical computing using R to use this language to solve and breakdown other aspects of the graduate research path.

### Additional data

For each individual using this repository there will be a different collection of parameters that are important for there own personal research career. This is where the `tidyPipes` approach allows others (and future me) to develop additional calendars, timetables and projections for future projects.

#### My additional data

##### 1. Seedling in the ACT



## Imputing data in the future



This is an R shiny app to create calendar plot using ggplot2. 

![](preview.png)

This app requires the following R packages: `ggplot2, shiny, colourpicker`. Run app using `runApp("app.R")`. Click [here](https://roymf.shinyapps.io/calendar_planner/) to see a demo of this app. This link may not always be active.

The app has been tested on:

# Introduction {.tabset}

Navigating the path between graduate studies and an academic career is a difficult task at the best of times. One of the key steps in becoming a establish researcher in the current academic environment. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./img/basic_calender_loop.png")
```

To do this efficiently, time management is one key aspect, however when there are so many little projects running it can be hard to know what to work on. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./img/data-mess.png")
```

This document is to record the method to proposing my 6month timeline for my PhD completion, as well as, showing the key aspects of the `tidyPipes` approach to research and the draft project plan for the invertebrate work I am proposing to do with Ben Kefford's lab.
